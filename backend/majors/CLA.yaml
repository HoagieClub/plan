description: |-
  The classics major is a flexible, interdisciplinary program that affords students a range of opportunities to study the cultures, languages, history, politics and intellectual traditions of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds, their contacts with other civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean, resonances in later ages and continued vitality today. The department offers two rigorous and highly flexible majors tracks, in which students chart their own paths within broad areas of study and are encouraged to develop innovative research projects, working closely with world-leading faculty, graduate students engaged in exciting scholarship and highly motivated undergraduate peers within the department. Because of the diversity of the topics studied by the faculty, ranging from Proto-Indo-European linguistics to medieval manuscripts to the cultural politics of the modern Caribbean, the department is able to support students exploring a wide range of subjects and pursuing independent work involving humanistic and social-scientific analysis, creative projects and experimental research. The unusually broad and diverse intellectual range of our program is matched by an intimate, supportive environment in which faculty and students work closely together.

    explanation: The classical studies program offers the opportunity 
      for sustained and focused inquiry into the history, literature and 
      culture of the ancient Mediterranean, as well as the impact of 
      classical antiquity on later periods by using a variety of 
      interpretative methods. The program offers students maximum 
      flexibility to chart their course through departmental and related 
      offerings. The particular program for each student is determined 
      in collaboration with the DUS, and should be coherent and lead to 
      viable research projects. Whatever the individual focus, each 
      student’s program must contain eight courses at the 200 level or 
      above (with limited exceptions as described below), including two 
      at the 300 level, plus the junior seminar.

      min_needed: 1
      explanation: Of the eight courses, one must deal primarily with 
        ancient literature, whether read in the original or in 
        translation; the sequence of CLG/LAT 105-108 may be counted as a 
        single departmental course and used to fulfill this requirement.

    explanation: The program offers students a pathway to explore the 
      history of ancient Greece and Rome and their relationships with 
      the neighboring cultures of the Near East, Europe and Africa. It 
      is also ideal for students interested in acquiring training in the 
      academic discipline of history while concentrating on the period 
      spanning the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1700 B.C.E.) to the early 
      medieval and Byzantine worlds (ca. 600 C.E.). Although students 
      may specialize in a particular field of history (political, 
      social, economic, cultural), geographic area or historical period 
      of antiquity, the aim of the program is to provide well-rounded 
      training in the field of history, with a focus on ancient history. 
      Each student’s program must contain eight courses at the 200 level 
      or above (with limited exceptions as described below), including 
      two at the 300 level, plus the junior seminar.

  explanation: |-
    During the fall of junior year, all majors take the junior seminar (CLA 340). The course introduces students to different fields of study within the department, including literature, ancient history, ancient culture, linguistics and reception studies. Students will gain experience in the methods of their chosen area(s) of study while acquiring an understanding of the history of the discipline and its place in the 21st century. Students will also acquire the skills necessary to pursue independent work. Students who are abroad during the fall of their junior year may complete the junior seminar during the fall semester of their senior year.

    In the fall term, each student researches and writes a paper of 12-15 pages on a topic of their choosing under the direction of a faculty adviser. The junior seminar will provide guidance in choosing and researching a topic. In the spring term, students undertake a more ambitious research paper of 20-25 pages. Each student again works closely with a member of the faculty on the project, meeting regularly over the course of the term.
