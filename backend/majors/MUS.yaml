type: Major
name: Music
code: MUS
degree: AB
explanation: |-
  The Department of Music aims to give students a broad foundation for making, performing, studying and writing about music. As part of the major, students pursue work in two loosely defined areas: Culture and Criticism (C&C) and Materials and Making (M&M). M&M encompasses topics usually explored in hands-on, exploratory ways, such as composition, improvisation, theory, analysis and electronic music. The C&C area focuses on the scholarly study of music, from historical and formalist analysis to cognitive science and ethnography. Whether our majors ultimately choose to make music, to research and write about it, or do both, they are encouraged to develop independent work that moves across traditional disciplinary or methodological boundaries. In more prosaic terms, we want our majors to discover a passion for what they are doing, while also learning how that passion aligns with developing abilities.

  explanation: The prerequisites are satisfied through the completion of 
    MUS 105, one M&M course, and one C&C course. Under special 
    circumstances, students may be able to place out of MUS 105 by 
    demonstrating equivalent knowledge in an exam given by the music 
    faculty or scoring a 5 on the AP Music exam. Students who place out 
    of MUS 105 will be required to take an additional elective to meet 
    the minimum requirement of 11 courses in the major.

  explanation: A fall-term Junior Seminar introduces students to some of the methodological,
    technical, creative, and disciplinary issues entailed in the study and making
    of music. Assignments may relate to, or inform, their independent work, but will
    be graded separately from the JIW. Students who are abroad during the fall of
    the junior year can complete the Junior Seminar during the fall term of the senior
    year.

    Junior independent work begins in the fall, usually in the context of the junior seminar, and continues into the spring with a faculty adviser. The nature of this work can vary greatly, but for reference, it might consist of a research paper of approximately 30–40 pages, or an original composition of roughly 6–10 minutes (which would typically include a short paper detailing motivations and context for the composition). These are only guidelines, and the eventual scale of the work will depend on its nature. The specific goals for the project are worked out with a faculty adviser (identified during the fall semester), resulting in a proposal consisting of a summary of the project aims and context, an outline and references to related work (bibliography for research papers, associated repertoire for compositions and other material as appropriate to the project); this proposal should be submitted to the adviser and DUS before the end of fall semester, though the grade for the proposal will be held and included in the final grade for the year-long project.

    The senior independent work consists of a year-long project devised by the student and approved by a faculty adviser. Again, for reference, it might consist of a research paper of approximately 60–80 pages, or an original composition of roughly 12–20 minutes (including a short accompanying paper), but the specific topics can vary widely, as described above; as with the JIW, these are only guidelines, and the eventual scale of the work will depend on its nature. Ideally, a faculty adviser will be identified in the spring of junior year to help the student develop an appropriate scope for the project. The JIW and SIW topics need not be related, but often are. The thesis grade is the average of the grades given by the faculty adviser and a second faculty reader.
