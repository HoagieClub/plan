explanation: |-
  English majors must take a total of 10 courses: the Junior Seminar (ENG 300), one designated course in Literary and Cultural History (LCH), and eight departmental courses. The junior seminar is a topical introduction to research methods in the discipline and prepares students for their independent work. Literary and Cultural History (LCH) courses ask questions about tradition and transmission over longer periods, and provide background for more specialized study.

      The completed junior paper takes the form of one 20-30-page JP, which is begun in conjunction with the junior seminar and which students complete in the spring semester, continuing the advising established during the junior seminar for the student's independent work.

      Students who study abroad may count up to two courses taken abroad as departmental courses. The exception to this is the English department's UCL semester: students may count two classes plus the Princeton seminar.<br><br>

      The Rule of 12. A student in the A.B. program is limited to 12 one-term courses (plus independent work) in a given department, plus up to two departmental prerequisites taken during the first year or sophomore year. Students who exceed the 31-course requirement for graduation may exceed the Rule of 12 by as many courses (e.g., if you take 32 courses total, you can exceed the rule of 12 by one course). For most English majors, this means only 12 courses primarily designated as English courses (ENG courses or cross-listed courses where ENG comes first—e.g., ENG 327/GSS 332). Departmental cognates do not count against the Rule of 12.<br><br>

      Cross-listed courses do not count against the Rule of 12 as long as the home department is not English.
