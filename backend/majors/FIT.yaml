      explanation: The minimum requirement for admission to the 
        department is successful completion of the language sequence 
        (FRE 107 or 108; ITA 107 or 108), or equivalent qualification. 
        Students are encouraged to complete at least one 
        advanced-language course (FRE 207, 207F, or 208; ITA 207I, 208) 
        prior to admission, or shortly thereafter, and may also count 
        one such course toward the major. It is further recommended that 
        students complete at least one more 200-level course (such as 
        FRE 211, 215, 217, 221, 222, 224, 225 or ITA 208, 209, 220, 224,

      explanation: The Department of French and Italian offers four 
        tracks for majors and a flexible, individualized approach to 
        course planning. Students either pursue a course of study 
        entirely in French or Italian, or combine this specialization
        with another language, academic discipline, or creative art. FIT 
        encourages innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to the 
        study of the Italian, French, and francophone worlds, tailored 
        to the unique academic and professional interests of students.

          Students intending to combine work in French or Italian and another related field normally take a minimum of eight upper-division courses: five in the relevant language and literature (one of which may be a cognate), and three in the other field. For example, students specializing in French or Italian and History, Politics, or Art and Archaeology, might take appropriate courses in those departments, such as HIS 350, 351, 345, or 365, POL 371, 372, or 381, or ART 319, 320, or 333.

        explanation: This track is designed for students wishing to combine work
          in French or Italian and a creative art, such as theater, music, dance,
          painting, film, and creative writing. Upon approval by the Director of Undergraduate
          Studies, the student would normally take a minimum of eight upper-division
          courses; five in the relevant language and literature and three in the field
          related to the art of interest. Up to two of the five departmental courses
          may be taken at the 200-level (but FRE 207 and 208, or ITA 207 and 208,
          cannot both be counted). In some cases, an original work of creation (paintings,
          prose or poetry…), or of performance (theatre…), may substitute for the
          Senior Thesis, but not for one of the two Junior Papers. In these cases,
          students will be required to also submit a substantial critical work of
          at least 6,000 but no more than 10,000 words (25-35 pages), in which they
          will position and discuss their creative work in relation to the historical
          and cultural context of the language in question.

    At the time of entering the department, and in all cases no later than spring of the sophomore year, students should discuss their likely area of interest with the departmental representative in order to make the attribution of junior advisers as appropriate as possible. The adviser will be assigned at the beginning of junior year. Students should get in touch with their Junior Adviser and plan regular meetings. In consultation with their adviser, students will also choose the language in which they will draft their paper. Responsibility for making and keeping these arrangements falls on the student.

    The first junior paper, written in the fall semester, should be about 4,000 words. The second junior paper, written in the spring semester, should be between 5,000 and 8,000 words. Both junior papers may be written in English, in which case a three-page summary in the relevant language must be provided. If the paper is written in the relevant language, a three-page summary in English is required.

    Students following tracks 2, 3 or 4 may write one junior paper in one of their two subjects of concentration, and one in the other.

    In preparing their papers students should conform to the principles specified in the University's instructions for the writing of essays. Presentation should follow either the Modern Language Association Handbook or The Chicago Manual of Style, with consistency.

    As the culmination of their independent work, senior students write a thesis on an approved topic. Late in their junior year, students will discuss possible areas of interest with the departmental representative. Topics chosen in the past have ranged across the field of French and Italian studies, from linguistic problems and literary techniques to close textual analysis to thematic and ideological study. Students primarily interested in culture and civilization have written on art, on political and economic issues, on education, and on a variety of social questions. For students following tracks 2, 3, and 4, joint supervision may be arranged. The senior thesis is a major commitment of a student's time and energy, and the most important yardstick for choosing a topic is willingness to spend many hours immersed in that particular set of texts or problems.

    Concentrators in French and/or Italian who are also earning certificates should consult with their advisers about selecting a suitable thesis topic. The senior thesis may be written in English, in which case a three-page summary in the relevant language must be provided. If the thesis is written in the relevant language, a three-page summary in English is required.

    Senior theses should not be more than 20,000 words, nor should they fall below 15,000 words.
