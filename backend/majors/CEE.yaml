code: CEE
degree: BSE
description: |-
  The department offers five tracks: architecture and engineering, 
  environmental engineering, geological engineering, structural 
  engineering, and engineering and the liberal arts. In the first year, 
  students should complete the mathematics, basic science, computing and
  writing requirements common to all B.S.E. programs. At the end of the 
  first year, the student declares CEE as a major and selects one of the
  tracks. Course requirements include engineering science courses, 
  engineering design courses, a senior thesis and program electives. 
  For all but the non-ABET accredited tracks, there are additional math 
  and science requirements that are normally satisfied by taking MAE 305
  Mathematics in Engineering, ORF 245 Fundamentals of Engineering 
  Statistics and GEO 203 Fundamentals of Solid Earth Science. In total, 
  a student's program of study must include a minimum of 14 engineering 
  courses, with the exception of students in the non-ABET accredited 
  tracks.

  The selection of a track provides a guide in the selection of program 
  electives. A student's program electives must provide a coherent 
  sequence in the student's area of interest. Approval is based on 
  agreement from the adviser and the director of studies. For a list of 
  preapproved electives, consult the CEE Academic Guide 
  (The Yellow Book). In addition, all candidates for the B.S.E. degree 
  are required to satisfy the general University and School of 
  Engineering and Applied Science requirements.

      The requirements include a strong emphasis on civil and
      environmental engineering. This track is designed for students who 
      intend to become practicing engineers and may attend graduate school 
      for architecture or engineering. This track is accredited by the 
      Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET under the program in 
      civil engineering. This track has architecture course requirements 
      beyond the normal requirements in civil and environmental 
      engineering.

      This track is designed for students who wish to pursue 
      a career related to the environment, whether in engineering, law, 
      business, public policy, hydrological, or health and 
      epidemiological sciences, and for students who wish to continue on 
      to advanced graduate studies in environmental engineering (or a 
      related earth science discipline). Coursework in environmental 
      engineering focuses on analysis of a broad range of environmental 
      problems as well as engineering design of innovative solutions to 
      these problems. This is done through a combination of coursework 
      in hydrological sciences, environmental sciences and geology, 
      applied to different environmental settings, and environmental 
      engineering design. The environmental engineering track is closely
      linked to the Environmental Studies Program of the High Meadows 
      Environmental Institute. This track is accredited by the 
      Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET under the program in 
      civil engineering. Students normally take the following courses.

      Geological engineering is the application of science to problems and
      projects involving Earth, its physical environment, Earth materials 
      and natural resources. The curriculum, offered in cooperation with 
      the Department of Geosciences, is specially designed for the student
      who wishes to build upon the first-year and sophomore mathematics 
      and engineering courses as a basis for studies in the Earth 
      sciences. Typical areas of study are water resources, engineering 
      geology, Earth resources, geotechnical engineering, geophysics, 
      geochemistry and atmospheres and oceans. This track is accredited 
      by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET under the 
      program in civil engineering. In addition to the general 
      requirements of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, 
      the following courses are required.

      Structural engineering is concerned with the analysis and design 
      of civil engineering structures with an emphasis on buildings, 
      bridges, stadiums, dams and foundations. Particular emphasis is 
      given to the design of these structures to resist earthquake and 
      wind loads. The program is designed to meet the needs of students 
      who are interested in continuing to advanced graduate studies or 
      who plan to go into engineering practice and consulting. This 
      track is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of
      ABET under the program in civil engineering. Its basic aim is the 
      preparation of flexible and innovative graduates who can address 
      the novel problems of modern engineering. Students in this program
      have the opportunity to interact directly with some of the best 
      design and consulting companies in structural engineering.

      This program is designed for students who wish to obtain an 
      engineering background as a foundation for a wide range of 
      careers, such as medicine, law, public policy, visual arts, or 
      engineering studies in materials, ethics, or history. Course work
      in this track should integrate engineering courses in a coherent
      manner with the topic of interest to the student. The track is 
      designed to be rigorous, yet allow for a wide degree of 
      flexibility in the course of studies.

      All students in engineering and the liberal arts are required to 
      take a minimum of six courses in engineering sciences that stress 
      design and analytical methods in civil and environmental 
      engineering. The program electives should form a coherent 
      sequence of at least four courses in the student's area of 
      interest, and junior independent research is strongly recommended 
      as a program elective. This is followed by the senior thesis. In 
      the junior independent research and senior thesis, students should
      relate their topics of interest to engineering problems.
