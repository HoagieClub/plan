  explanation: Independent reading, the junior seminar, the junior year 
    essay and the senior thesis constitute the student's total 
    independent work, which is spread over the four upper-level terms. 
    These elements can be profitably linked with departmental courses. 
    Students will consult with the director of undergraduate studies 
    under whose guidance they will develop their individual program. 
    During the first term of junior year, students are required to take 
    the Junior Seminar GER 300, which serves as an intensive workshop of 
    research and writing skills, as an introduction to a wide range of 
    approaches and methods, and as an incubator for the spring term 
    junior paper, an essay of approximately 5,000 words on a subject in 
    German philosophy, art, media, linguistics, literature or politics. 
    This essay, as well as the senior thesis, may be written in German 
    or English. In late April of their junior year, students should 
    discuss plans for their senior theses with the director of 
    undergraduate studies.

    During senior year, students will write a thesis on a subject developed together with and approved by their thesis adviser. By the end of the fourth week of the first senior term, students will submit to their advisers a tentative outline of the proposed thesis. Further progress reports (as announced by the department) are required. Five weeks before the departmental examination, students must deliver to their adviser and to the director of undergraduate studies a copy of the thesis (signed and in PDF format).

  explanation: For tracks 1 to 5, at least three, and for track 6, at 
    least two, of the departmentals should be courses taught in German. 
    For tracks 1 to 5, one of these three may be a course taught in 
    English for which there is an appropriate German-language component. 
    This option is available for all courses taught in the German 
    department, but also for some courses in other departments. Students 
    should consult with the course instructor regarding the 
    German-language component at the beginning of the semester and 
    submit the agreed-upon plan to the director of undergraduate studies 
    for approval by the end of the second week of classes.
