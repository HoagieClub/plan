description: |-
  The department offers two programs of study: mechanical engineering
  and aerospace engineering. These programs draw on courses in the 
  underlying fundamental sciences and mathematics during the first year,
  which lead to broad introductory engineering science courses during
  the second year, where students are introduced to the creative
  application of this knowledge to the solution of technical problems.
  Aspects of engineering design, the process of devising a system to
  meet a need, are introduced to the student through laboratories in
  the second year and continue through the upper-level years. Starting
  as early as the second semester of the sophomore year students 
  take a two-semester design sequence as well as engineering science
  courses dealing with analysis and application in the areas of energy
  sources and power systems, structures, aerodynamics and flow systems,
  and the dynamics of machines and their control. The early introduction
  of design, combined with further depth in engineering science, enables
  students to undertake realistic design projects during their senior
  year. The programs are designed to prepare the graduate for an 
  engineering career and give them the ability to continue to grow
  professionally.

    Requirements for study in the department follow the general 
    requirements for the School of Engineering and Applied Science. 
    In addition, the following four courses and one laboratory are 
    normally completed by departmental students before entry into the
    junior year.

      MAE 206 is not required for those pursuing only the aerospace
      degree. Instead, for those students the dynamics requirements
      is met by an upper-level course focused on aerospace dynamics,
      e.g. MAE 331 or MAE 341.

    In order to qualify for graduation, each departmental student must
    1). satisfactorily complete an upper-level course involving
    applications of mathematics, MAE 305 Mathematics in Engineering I,
    and 2). complete eight upper-level departmental courses. Among
    these are engineering science courses select from the following

  explanation: |-
    Senior Independent Work is the culminating experience for the mechanical and aerospace
    engineering programs. All seniors are required to participate in a research or engineering
    project. All projects must include elements of engineering design (engineering design is the
    process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs). The following
    courses satisfy this requirement: MAE 439 Senior Independent Work (one semester, fall);
    MAE 440 Senior Independent Work (one semester, spring); MAE 442 Senior Thesis (yearlong);
    MAE 444 Senior Project (year-long). Students are strongly encouraged to select
    the year-long project or thesis option. Senior projects are intended for teams or groups
    while senior thesis is intended for individuals. For senior project or thesis, work begins in
    the fall but enrollment is only in spring term when a double grade is awarded. Please note:
    If a student has selected to participate in a year-long project or thesis and is enrolled in only
    three courses during the fall semester, it is required that they will enroll in Senior Project or
    Thesis during the spring semester. For these students, it will NOT be possible to drop-down
    to a one-semester course of Independent Work without incurring a failure for Independent
    Work in the fall term. In Spring term you must enroll in three courses plus senior thesis or
    senior project (senior thesis and senior project count as two courses). Therefore your senior
    year course load will be 3 in fall and 5 in spring as opposed to 4 in fall and 4 in spring.
    There are NO exceptions to this rule even if your total number of courses will exceed 36.
