description: |-
  Operations research and financial engineering may be considered as the
  modern form of a liberal education: modern because it is based on 
  science, mathematics, computing and technology, and liberal in the 
  sense that it provides for broad intellectual development and can 
  lead to many different types of careers. By choosing judiciously from
  courses in engineering, science, mathematics, economics, public 
  policy, and liberal arts, each student may design a program adapted
  to his or her particular interests.

  All students start from a common academic core consisting of
  statistics, probability and stochastic processes, and optimization.
  Related courses focus on developing computer skills and exposing
  students to applications in areas such as finance, operations, 
  transportation, and logistics. Students augment the core program with
  a coherent sequence of departmental electives. Students may also
  design specialized programs in areas such as medicine and 
  neuroscience, which must be reviewed and approved by their academic
  adviser and the departmental representative. Students often draw on
  courses from economics, computer science, applied mathematics, civil
  and environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry,
  molecular biology, psychology, and public and international affairs.
  Requirements for study in the department follow the general
  requirements for the School of Engineering and Applied Science
  and the University.

      max_counted: 1
      min_needed: 1
      explanation: A first introduction to probability and statistics. 
        This course will provide background to understand and produce rigorous
        statistical analysis including estimation, confidence intervals, 
        hypothesis testing and regression and classification. Applicability and
        limitations of these methods will be illustrated using a variety of 
        modern real world data sets and manipulation of the statistical 
        software R. MAT 201 concurrent or equivalent or approved by instructor.

        Placement Exam option. Some students may have substantial prior 
        knowledge of engineering statistics. For them, the “Core Requirement”
        aspects of ORF 245, Fundamentals of Engineering Statistics, can be 
        satisfied by a “core-requirement exam”. The 3-hour exam is administered
        in January to student(s) who have applied to the ORFE Director of 
        Undergraduate Studies prior to the previous December 1 for permission
        to take the exam, and received authorization by the ORF 245 Exam 
        Committee. The application should clearly state, including supporting
        documentation, why the student feels they already have a firm grasp of
        the Fundamentals of Engineering Statistics. Note passing the exam 
        satisfies the “Core Requirement of ORF 245” but does not contribute
        a course to the BSE degree’s “36 courses” requirement and it increases
        ORFE’s “Departmental Elective” requirement from 10 to 11, one of which
        must now be an advanced statistics course. In short, the “Core 
        Requirement” for statistics can be satisfied by either taking and 
        passing ORF 245 or for those with sufficient advanced knowledge, passing
        the ORF 245 exam and passing an advanced statistics course. 
        (The exam option was added to the Academic Guide effective 8/1/2021).

    - name: Optimization
      max_counted: 1
      min_needed: 1
      explanation: This course focuses on analytical and computational
        tools for optimization. We will introduce least-squares 
        optimization with multiple objectives and constraints. We will
        also discuss linear optimization modeling, duality, the simplex
        method, degeneracy, interior point methods and network flow 
        optimization. Finally, we will cover integer programming and 
        branch-and-bound algorithms. A broad spectrum of real-world 
        applications in engineering, finance and statistics is 
        presented. Prerequisite is MAT 202 or 204. It is strongly 
        recommended that COS 126 or equivalent be taken prior to or
        concurrently with this course.

    - name: Financial Mathematics
      max_counted: 1
      min_needed: 1
      explanation: Financial Mathematics is concerned with designing
        and analyzing products that improve the efficiency of markets,
        and create mechanisms for reducing risk. This course develops 
        quantitative methods for the notions of arbitrage and 
        risk-neutral pricing in discrete time, specific models such
        as Black-Scholes and Heston in continuous time, and calibration
        to market data. Credit derivatives, the term structure of
        interest rates, and robust techniques in the context of 
        volatility options will be discussed, as well as lessons from
        the financial crisis. Prerequisites are MAT 104 and ORF 309.

Students interested in a full-year senior thesis must be willing to spend the appropriate time during both the fall and the spring semesters.

    Students who are unable to make adequate progress can switch to ORF 479 and be required to take eleven departmental electives. Students will enroll in the spring and will receive credit for two course grades given in the spring.

    Senior Independent Project - ORF 479 (Spring semester only) - A short progress report will be due in January, (Dean’s Date) to make sure that the students have chosen a suitable topic and matched up with their advisor. The final outcome will be a report due at the end of the spring semester. The report will fully describe the research project and its results. Typically projects will take approximately 30 to 50 pages. (Also, students who take the independent project will need to take an additional 4XX ORFE departmental elective.)
