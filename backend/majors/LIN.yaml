description:
  Students at Princeton develop the skills of a linguist through 
  hands-on engagement with gathering and interpreting data from many 
  different languages, the employment of diverse methodologies, and the 
  investigation of language through a variety of lenses, including;
  
  1. Working with native speakers of an unfamiliar language (Field 
  Methods).
  2. Engaging with descriptive grammars and large-scale statistical 
  correlations to investigate similarities and differences across 
  languages (Linguistic Typology).
  3. Analyzing texts to elucidate how language changes over time 
  (Historical Linguistics).
  4. Modeling linguistic differences across dialects and social contexts 
  (Sociolinguistics).
  5. Measuring linguistic behaviors in controlled experimental contexts 
  (Psycholinguistics).
  6. Observing how languages develop/coexist within speakers (Language 
  Acquisition, Bilingualism).

  explanation: |- 
    The student should have taken (or should be taking) LIN 201/CGS 205 
    ("Introduction to Language and Linguistics") prior to submitting an application 
    (i.e., during or before the Fall semester of their sophomore year). This
    prerequisite may be waived in special circumstances with the permission of
    the Director of Undergraduate Studies; if waived, then the student is not
    required to take a different course in place of LIN 201/CGS 205. In addition
    to the prerequisite, any student planning to major in Linguistics is strongly
    encouraged to complete at least one 300-level LIN course prior to the beginning
    of their junior year.

    (a) The student must complete LIN 400 ("Junior Seminar") in the Fall semester of
    their junior year.
    (b) The student must also take one other methodology class and is strongly encouraged
    to do so before their senior year. LIN 355 ("Field Methods in Linguistics") is offered
    regularly, and is the primary way this requirement will be fulfilled. However, in some
    cases, a different LIN-designated course (one that is not taught regularly, e.g., LIN 356,
    "Experimental Linguistics") may serve to fulfill this requirement.

    The student must take four other LIN courses, at least three of them at the 300
    level or above; the fourth must be at the 200 level or above. (In rare cases, a
    linguistically-oriented course without a LIN designation can count as an elective,
    with the case-by-case approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies.) Topics
    that are regularly offered include bilingualism, historical linguistics, advanced
    phonology, advanced morphology, and advanced syntax, though this short list is meant
    to be merely illustrative and students are by no means confined to it.

    <i>Editor's Note: Majors do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>
  
    The student must complete both of the following research papers, on linguistic
    topics: a Junior Paper (JP) and a Senior Thesis (ST). Each is due in the Spring
    semester of the relevant year, on the respective University-set deadlines. Each
    student is encouraged to begin conceptualizing ideas for their independent work
    projects before the academic year when the project begins, through meetings with
    LIN faculty. The JP includes a JP prospectus, to be completed in the Fall of junior
    year, employing the skills concurrently being developed in LIN 400, "Junior Seminar."
    The ST includes an ST prospectus, to be completed in the Fall of senior year, as well
    as an ST defense in the Spring of senior year.

    The JP and ST may be supervised by one of the two faculty members who serve as the
    student's faculty advisors for the independent major, but need not be. Independent
    work advisors are determined as soon as possible; for the JP, this will be by mid-way
    through Fall semester of junior year, and for the ST this will be by week 2 of the
    Fall semester of senior year.

    Each work requires at least one advisor who is within LIN; this is defined as someone
    who either: (a) is a LIN-appointed faculty member, or (b) has the rank of Visiting
    Professor,  Associate Research Scholar, Postdoctoral Research Associate, or Lecturer,
    with “Linguistics” in their title. If a student has an independent work advisor from
    outside of LIN, they must also have a secondary advisor who is within LIN.
