  explanation: To enter the department, a student must complete, by the end of sophomore
    year, the prerequisite courses ECO 100, ECO 101, ECO 202 (or equivalent), and
    MAT (175 or equivalent), earning a letter grade of C or better in each course.
    ORF 245 can be substituted for ECO 202. POL 345 followed by POL 346 can also be
    used to satisfy our statistics pre-requirement. (POL 345 alone is not sufficient).
    PSY 251, SPI 200 and SOC 301 are also not accepted. The statistics pre-requirement
    cannot be satisfied with summer courses taken after the student has begun studies
    at Princeton, except in unusual circumstances approved by the departmental representative,
    Professor Smita Brunnermeier (smita@princeton.edu).

      Majors must complete MAT 175 (or equivalent) by the end of sophomore year and earn a letter grade of C or better in each course. MAT 201 or EGR 156 can be substituted for MAT 175.
      
      It is highly recommended that students who wish to take math-track econometrics (ECO 312) or upper-level finance certificate courses (such as ECO 462, ECO 465 and ECO 466), or pursue graduate studies in economics and finance take MAT 201 and MAT 202 instead of one semester of MAT 175 or EGR 156. Both MAT 201 and MAT 202 should be taken for a letter grade by this subset of students.

- name: Core Courses
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: ALL
  explanation: |-
    All majors must pass, on a graded basis, core courses in microeconomics (ECO 300 or 310), macroeconomics (ECO 301 or 311) and econometrics (ECO 302 or 312). These courses must be completed during or before the junior year. Each of the three core courses is offered in two versions to accommodate different levels of preparation in mathematics: ECO 300, ECO 301 and ECO 302 require MAT 175 or equivalent. ECO 310 and ECO 311 require MAT 201. ECO 312 requires MAT 201 + MAT 202.

    Qualified students are encouraged to take the more mathematical versions. It is not necessary to take all three courses in the same version.

  explanation: |-
    In addition to the three core courses, majors must pass, on a graded basis, five other departmental courses. Departmentals can be any 300-, 400-, or 500-level Economics courses, or an approved cognate.

    Students planning a senior thesis with empirical emphasis are strongly encouraged to take ECO 313; students planning a theoretical senior thesis are strongly encouraged to take ECO 317 and/or ECO 418.

    explanation: Economics majors are allowed to count a maximum of two courses from
      other departments as cognates. These courses need to have substantial economics
      content. A course with an Economics cross-listing (indicated by an ECO 3XX,
      ECO 4XX, or ECO 5XX number in its first or second listing) counts as a regular
      departmental, not as a cognate. Courses that will be automatically recognized
      by TigerHub as cognates are listed below. No application is necessary for these
      courses.

    explanation: |-
      The Department offers a program in political economy track for Economics concentrators. Program participants meet all the general requirements of Economics concentrators, and, in addition: (1) complete two Politics courses at any level before entering the program; (2) complete three 300-level (or higher) Politics courses during junior and senior years, and (3) conduct junior independent work with a political economy component.

      One Politics course approved as an Economics cognate may also count toward the program’s requirements. Admission to the program takes place at the beginning of the junior year, in consultation with the Political Economy Representative in Economics. Concentrators who successfully complete the program’s requirements receive a certificate in Political Economy from the Department.  The coordinator of the program is Professor Silvia Weyerbrock.

    <p>Independent work is designed to afford concentrators the opportunity to identify and explore their research interests in depth. Students are expected to develop a carefully reasoned exposition that critically analyzes a problem using basic principles of economics. Juniors complete a year-long research project, which consists of a research prospectus submitted in December and a final paper submitted in April.</p>

    <p>Independent work is designed to afford concentrators the opportunity to identify and explore their research interests in depth. Students are expected to develop a carefully reasoned exposition that critically analyzes a problem using basic principles of economics. Unlike junior independent work, the senior thesis is expected to be more extensive, with a topic of greater scope and, correspondingly broader analysis and interpretation.</p>
