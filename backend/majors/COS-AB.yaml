degree: AB
description: |-
  With computation and computer science now permeating all corners of 
  society and the economy, a computer science education has become a 
  good launching pad for almost any career. Core concepts and skills 
  emphasized in the computer science curriculum include theoretical and 
  quantitative analysis of computation; design/engineering principles of
  advanced computer systems; and foundations and methods of AI and 
  Machine Learning.

  The curriculum provides additional flexibility to explore 
  sub-disciplines of computer science (Programming Languages, 
  Formal Methods, Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, 
  Computer Graphics, Information Security), or to branch out into 
  exciting cross-disciplinary investigations (Neuroscience and 
  Cognitive Science, Computational Biology, Information Policy, 
  Robotics, Data Science, etc.). Most computer science majors enjoy 
  programming. Quite a few start with zero or minimal background and 
  are able to enhance their skills while progressing through the 
  curriculum.

    The prerequisites are any one of MAT 202/204/217 or EGR 154; 
    COS 126; COS 217 and 226. Students should plan to take both COS 217 
    and COS 226 before their junior year since at least one of them is a
    required prerequisite for all computer science departmentals.

      This category contains courses that either explore another 
      sub-discipline beyond Systems/Theory/AIML, or provide experience 
      with real-world applications. At least one must be taken. At the
      moment this is the complete list; other COS courses are electives.

    Students must take three COS courses numbered 300 - 400 level. 
    Graduate courses do not count as electives.

    Alternatively, up to two electives may be chosen from a list of 
    approved courses from other departments.  Any 300- or 400- level 
    Math or ECE or ORF course that does not duplicate COS content, 
    MAE 345, MOL 437/NEU 437, NEU 330, and ECO 326 count as electives.
    Graduate courses in other departments may not be used as electives.
