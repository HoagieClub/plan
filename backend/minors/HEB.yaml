    At the end of their language study at Princeton, a student
    minoring in Hebrew language must work to submit a polished
    translation from a work in Hebrew in order to complete the
    requirements of the minor. This translation could be from a
    work of literature (e.g., an excerpt of a prose work, a poem,
    a short story), an essay, a film, a song or another piece
    approved by NES language faculty. Translations must be submitted
    to the director of undergraduate studies before Dean's Date in the
    student's final semester. This submission should also include a list
    of the student's departmental and language courses and any other
    courses or experience that might be relevant to the minor, such as
    study abroad or internships related to the Near East.
