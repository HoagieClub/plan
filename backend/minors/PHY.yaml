description: |-
  Interdisciplinary areas in physical sciences in engineering such as energy,
  environment, materials,microelectronics, astronautics and photonics promise
  to become increasingly relevant in the 21st century. The Program in Engineering
  Physics, which provides students with a fundamental knowledge of physics,
  together with problem-solving skills and an understanding of engineering, is
  designed to address the needs of students seeking innovative careers in today's
  technological age. In addition, it allows students to keep their options open
  between physical sciences and engineering. Following completion of the engineering
  physics program, students typically enter careers in engineering,
  applied science or applied physics through research, teaching or entrepreneurial
  engineering. Past graduates have also pursued other careers as diverse as medicine,
  business and law.

  The program offers a unique combination of engineering,
  mathematics and physics. It is directed toward students who have an interest
  and ability in both engineering and physics. For engineering majors, in addition
  to courses in those subjects fundamental to the student's field of interest,
  the program requires completion of courses in quantum mechanics and encourages
  the study of subjects such as electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics,
  condensed matter physics, mathematical physics, complex analysis and partial
  differential equations. For physics majors, the program requires courses in areas
  such as solid-state electronics, fluid mechanics, optics/optoelectronics, control
  theory, computers and computational methods or a variety of other applied disciplines.
  Computer science A.B. students are required to meet the technical course requirements
  needed to satisfy the B.S.E. degree.

    For B.S.E. students, these should be five PHY courses at the 200 level or higher,
    including a course in quantum mechanics (PHY 208).  Of these, at least four must be
    listed or cross-listed as physics (PHY) courses.  A fifth may be a course with strong
    physics content from other departments such as AST or CHM, but must be approved in
    advance by the program's committee. <br><br>
    
    For PHY majors, these should be five engineering courses from one or more of the
    participating engineering departments.  In order to gain exposure to the design-oriented
    philosophy of engineering, physics students are required to take at least two of their
    engineering courses in a coherent area of study so that a clear engineering stem can be
    identified.

    <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    Close collaboration with faculty is expected. Students are required to complete,
    with a grade of B- or better, at least one semester of independent work in an
    appropriate area.  Physics students are encouraged to have a professor in
    engineering serve as a reader on their senior thesis.
