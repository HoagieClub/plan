description: The goal of the minor in mathematics is to allow students 
  to explore contemporary mathematics, either as a topic for its own sake 
  or to gain a deeper knowledge of a specific area most relevant for the 
  students’ work in their major field of concentration. In consultation 
  with the minor program director of the mathematics department, the 
  student should develop a plan that complements their work in their 
  chosen field of concentration. The plan can be to gain a broad knowledge 
  of mathematics, in which case we recommend courses in algebra, complex 
  analysis and real analysis. Alternatively, students with a strong 
  interest in a more specialized area of mathematics can choose a 
  sequence of courses in that field. The student should contact the minor 
  program director of the mathematics department during the spring of 
  sophomore year to have a course plan approved. Later admission to the 
  Program is allowed during the junior year, though this offers less 
  flexibility in the choice of the required courses. 

  Normally, students may not pursue both the minor in PACM and the minor 
  in MAT. However, students who believe they have a compelling curricular 
  reason to pursue both may apply to the directors of both programs for 
  permission to do so.

  explanation: The recommended preparation for the minor is the same as
    for the major in math; knowledge of calculus (both single and several
    variable), linear algebra and familiarity with proofs. With the prior 
    approval of the minor program director, students may count one course 
    taken in another department toward the minor prerequisites. These 
    courses should be completed by the end of sophomore year.

  explanation: The minor requires four mathematics department courses at 
    the 300 level or higher. By permission, one of these can be a cognate 
    if it fits into the student’s plan and is approved in advance. These 
    courses cannot be counted for the student’s major or for other minors 
    or certificates.

    <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    One Junior Seminar in the mathematics department is 
    required, which can be taken in the senior year. Exceptionally, if the 
    plan of the student justifies it, the Junior Seminar can be replaced 
    by a Junior Paper, which can be done in the senior year or as a summer 
    project.
