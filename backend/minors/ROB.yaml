description: The minor in robotics seeks to provide students from a 
  diverse range of majors an opportunity to gain an appreciation for these 
  challenges, develop an understanding of the current state of the art, 
  explore the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary nature of robotics, 
  consider issues of societal significance, and put these lessons into 
  practice through project-based assignments in courses and through an 
  independent work project or thesis.

    explanation: The minor is open to students from any major who have 
      a satisfactory background in mathematics, physics, and computing.  
      Students should have successfully completed or placed out of 
      mathematics, introductory physics (including mechanics), and 
      intoductory computer science.

      <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>
      A one-term senior independent work project or two-term 
      senior thesis whose topic is relevant to robotics must be 
      completed and approved by the director through the online 
      portal.  Junior independent work projects do not fulfill the 
      minor requirement. A minimum grade of B– for the project or 
      thesis is required to qualify for the minor.
