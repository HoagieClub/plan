  explanation: |-
  Five courses cross-listed with LAS or with a strong Latin American, 
  Caribbean or Brazilian component, of which one must be a seminar and one 
  must be in the humanities. Students can double-count up to two courses with 
  their major. Alternatively, students can fulfill the minor requirements by 
  taking four courses and, in lieu of a fifth course, completing one of the 
  following options
  - Complete a senior thesis on a Latin American or Caribbean topic, or with 
  significant Latin American and/or Caribbean content;
  - Have a meaningful, at least 6- to 10-week-long, structured experience in 
  Latin America or the Caribbean through an internship, an independent research 
  project or a service project. After they return, students must submit a 
  1,000-word memo describing their international experience and its relevance 
  to the LAS minor. Participation in the Bridge Year Program in a Latin American 
  country may count toward the fulfillment of this requirement.
  - Write a 6,000-8000-word research paper on Latin America or the Caribbean. 
  Students can submit a relevant junior research paper or expand a course final 
  paper under the supervision of a PLAS faculty member.
