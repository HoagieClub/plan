    At the end of their language study at Princeton, a student minoring 
    in Arabic language must work to submit a polished translation from 
    a work in Arabic in order to complete the requirements of the minor. 
    This translation could be from a work of literature (e.g., an excerpt 
    of a prose work, a poem, a short story), an essay, a film, a song or 
    another piece approved by NES language faculty. Translations must be 
    submitted to the director of undergraduate studies before Dean's Date 
    in the student's final semester. This submission should also include a 
    list of the studentâ€™s departmental and language courses and any other 
    courses or experience that might be relevant to the minor, such as 
    study abroad or internships related to the Near East.
