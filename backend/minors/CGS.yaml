description: Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the 
mind, brain, and intelligent systems, drawing predominantly on research 
from psychology, philosophy, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, 
and anthropology. The interdisciplinary character of cognitive science is 
reflected in its reliance on many levels of analysis and its employment of 
a variety of methodologies appropriate to each level. The goal of cognitive 
\science is to integrate the insights from multiple disciplines and modes of
research into a unified scientific account of minds – be they human or 
non-human, natural or artificial – and their place in nature and society.
