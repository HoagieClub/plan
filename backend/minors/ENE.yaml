description: The future well-being of societies, the global economy, and the global environment will benefit greatly 
  from collaborative research into renewable energy, alternative fuels, advanced energy conversion and storage systems, 
  remediation of environmental degradation, technology transfer to developing countries, and prudent judgment on policies 
  to support sustainable energy technology. Innovations and inventions require multidisciplinary approaches and 
  entrepreneurship, as well as grounding in theory and practice, all topics that are not covered by a single department. 
  The Minor Program in Sustainable Energy (the Minor) offers an integrated set of core and elective courses, introducing 
  students to fundamental concepts in energy technologies and technological change, providing depth in specific fields of 
  interest from specific energy systems to policy approaches that further sustainable energy use, exposure to laboratory 
  practices and experiences, and setting the stage for further work in the field.

    Students must take four additional courses related to energy systems, technology, and policy. Students 
    may choose from a list of approved electives that is reviewed each year by the Minor director. The list 
    is organized by the six research foci of the Andlinger Center so that students can gain depth of knowledge 
    in a particular area of sustainable energy, but students are free to choose any four courses from this list 
    following these guidelines.

    Gaining knowledge about energy systems and outcomes from a variety of perspectives is an important goal of the 
    Minor program.  The Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment offers monthly Highlight Seminars featuring 
    talks on energy topics given by speakers in disciplines including engineering, technology, economics, and public 
    policy.  During their junior and senior years, students are required to attend a total of four of the Andlinger 
    Centerâ€™s monthly Highlight Seminars* and write a short, half-page reaction paper for each seminar that should be 
    emailed to the program manager.

    Students must conduct independent research on a suitable energy topic, which can take one of the following four forms: 
    a substantial part (e.g., a chapter) of their senior thesis, which topic must be approved ahead of time by the Minor 
    director. a junior paper submitted to fulfill a departmental requirement; the topic must be approved by the Minor 
    director ahead of time. a 10-15pp final report based on work done (at any stage of their undergrad career) during an 
    Andlinger Center summer internship supervised by an Andlinger Center or Andlinger Center-affiliated faculty member. 
    The supervising faculty must review and sign off on the paper as being of sufficient quality to satisfy an independent 
    paper requirement (e.g., a JP). a 10-15pp independent paper supervised and approved by an Andlinger Center or Andlinger 
    Center-affiliated faculty member, topic approved ahead of time by the Minor director.
