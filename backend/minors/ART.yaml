  The Program in Archaeology is designed to provide students with an
  interdisciplinary foundation in archaeology - the study of the material
  remains of the past - and to equip students to use archaeological evidence
  in other fields of inquiry. The program offers courses that cover many
  cultures and periods, including Egypt, the Near East, Greece, Rome and the
  Americas. It encourages a deep integration of the humanities, the sciences
  and engineering, and promotes awareness of issues of cultural heritage. <br> <br>

  Once subfields of ancient art or ancient history, archaeology today
  embraces anthropological approaches as well as the physical and social
  sciences. Technology has transformed the practice of archaeology, with
  tools such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), geographic information system
  (GIS), and photogrammetry, offering new insights. Yet archaeology is not just
  concerned with uncovering and understanding the past; it is also devoted to
  protecting it. Rampant looting and the destruction of sites have placed
  archaeologists at the forefront of discussions on cultural heritage. Many
  of the program courses, therefore, including the required methods course
  (ART 401), highlight ethical and political dimensions of archaeology.

    ART 304: Archaeology in the Field or its equivalent. <br><br>

    "Fieldwork" is not limited to excavation. Sustained engagement
    in any aspect of an archaeological project fulfills the obligation.
    Students may, for example, assist in a geophysical survey,
    participate in a surface survey, work in archaeological archives,
    or intern for a zoologist. Fieldwork must be pre-approved by the program
    director and last at least a month. Financial support for fieldwork is
    available. There is also financial support for internships with non-profits
    that count towards the fieldwork requirement.
