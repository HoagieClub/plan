  The Program in Archaeology is designed to provide students with an
  interdisciplinary foundation in archaeology - the study of the material
  remains of the past - and to equip students to use archaeological evidence
  in other fields of inquiry. The program offers courses that cover many
  cultures and periods, including Egypt, the Near East, Greece, Rome and the
  Americas. It encourages a deep integration of the humanities, the sciences
  and engineering, and promotes awareness of issues of cultural heritage. <br> <br>

  Once subfields of ancient art or ancient history, archaeology today
  embraces anthropological approaches as well as the physical and social
  sciences. Technology has transformed the practice of archaeology, with
  tools such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), geographic information system
  (GIS), and photogrammetry, offering new insights. Yet archaeology is not just
  concerned with uncovering and understanding the past; it is also devoted to
  protecting it. Rampant looting and the destruction of sites have placed
  archaeologists at the forefront of discussions on cultural heritage. Many
  of the program courses, therefore, including the required methods course
  (ART 401), highlight ethical and political dimensions of archaeology.

    Students should declare in the spring of their sophomore

      director to form a coherent body of coursework. <br> <br>

      One course may be taken pass/D/fail, with the exception of ART 401.
      Students may double-count up to two courses toward the minor and

    ART 304: Archaeology in the Field or its equivalent. <br><br>

    "Fieldwork" is not limited to excavation. Sustained engagement
    in any aspect of an archaeological project fulfills the obligation.
    Students may, for example, assist in a geophysical survey,
    participate in a surface survey, work in archaeological archives,
    or intern for a zoologist. Fieldwork must be pre-approved by the program
    director and last at least a month. Financial support for fieldwork is
    available. There is also financial support for internships with non-profits
    that count towards the fieldwork requirement.

    Students undertake independent research, which may take one of three forms
    1) a senior thesis with a substantial archaeological component; <br>
    2) a junior paper on an archaeological topic; <br>
    3) or a 25-page research paper on an archaeological topic. <br><br>

    Independent work must be submitted by 5:00pm on Dean's Date. Only theses
    are eligible for the Frederick Barnard White Prize in Archaeology.

name: History of Art
code: ART
degree:
description: The Department of Art and Archaeology studies artwork and 
  material artifacts from a wide range of cultures and periods, approaching 
  them in historical perspective. Art history’s subjects include drawing, 
  painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and the built environment, 
  ceramics, lacquer, metalwork, glass and textiles; along with a wide range 
  of images and phenomena or experiences shaped by artistic craft, including
  cinema, performance, print culture, urbanism, scientific illustration and 
  mass media. Students of art history learn to translate observations into 
  linguistic expression, develop visual and experiential memory and make 
  connections among a wide array of historical evidence. They practice 
  techniques for analyzing and interpreting the visual and material world 
  by actively engaging primary sources—often through the direct study of 
  original works in Princeton’s collections and local museums.<br><br>

  Art historians pursue their work in many different ways, and the research 
  questions of the field take varied forms. The fundamental methods of the 
  discipline rely on close observation and deeply researched contextualization. 
  The contemporary practice of art history attends not only to visual analysis 
  and the study of materials and techniques, but also to the full spectrum of 
  elements that bear upon art’s making and its apprehension (including sound, 
  smell, texture, motion, etc. — all in historically situated context). 
  Art-historical research often considers the social, political, philosophical, 
  literary, economic, scientific, technological or religious culture of a 
  particular period, community or region. Art historians frequently collaborate 
  with scholars in the sciences as they study the material composition of 
  artworks, and the field is conducive to technology-based projects and methods 
  (such as imaging technologies and data visualization).<br><br>

  "The field is by nature interdisciplinary:" it draws on the ideas, information, 
  theories and resources of diverse branches of knowledge, as art historians 
  seek to understand the cultural fabric of which a given work of art forms a 
  part. As such, a minor in the History of Art may complement a major in a wide 
  range of disciplines across all University divisions. The skills of 
  observation, analysis and research that students cultivate through 
  art-historical practice prove valuable in fields from medicine and law to 
  engineering and biological- or conservation science, along with all branches 
  of the humanities and social sciences.

    Minors must take one course in each of the department’s three 
    distribution areas: Ancient (Group 1), Medieval and Early Modern

    designations are included in the Registrar’s course listings, and will
