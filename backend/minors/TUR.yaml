  The Department of Near Eastern Studies offers a wide variety of undergraduate classes focused on the languages, histories and cultures of the Near East. It provides opportunities for those who plan to major in other disciplines to simultaneously obtain proficiency in Turkish and to deepen their knowledge of the history, politics, literature, religion and culture of the premodern and modern Near East.

    explanation: |-
      A student majoring in a department other than Near Eastern Studies may earn a minor in Turkish language by completing five courses, including at least four courses in Turkish taken at the intermediate level (i.e., second-year, course numbers 105-107) or above; as well as a fifth Near Eastern Studies course (either an additional language class or a content class listed or cross-listed in Near Eastern Studies). Only in exceptional cases approved by the NES director of undergraduate studies will a class not listed in NES be counted toward the fifth course requirement. Courses taken on a pass/D/fail basis will not be counted toward the minor.

        explanation: |-
          At the end of their language study at Princeton, a student minoring in Turkish language must work to submit a polished translation from a work in Turkish in order to complete the requirements of the minor. This translation could be from a work of literature (e.g., an excerpt of a prose work, a poem, a short story), an essay, a film, a song or another piece approved by NES language faculty. Translations must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies before Dean's Date in the student's final semester. This submission should also include a list of the student's departmental and language courses and any other courses or experience that might be relevant to the minor, such as study abroad or internships related to the Near East.

      Courses taken abroad in summer language programs or over the course of a semester or year at other institutions may count toward minor requirements. For more information on Study Abroad programs, please contact the language teachers of the relevant languages in the Department of Near Eastern Studies. Preapproval for any non-Princeton program coursework must be obtained from the NES director of undergraduate studies.
