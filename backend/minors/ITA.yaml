  around the world allows students to learn directly about two of the richest and most influential
  cultural traditions in world history (including Italian art). It also gives students necessary
  insight into major historical events and processes, such as nation-building,revolution, colonialism, 
  fascism, migration and democratization, which still resonate and continue to shape the modern world.

    To enter the minor in Italian, students are required to successfully complete the language sequence 
    in Italian (ITA 107, 108 or 1027), or to demonstrate the equivalent level of proficiency. To enter 
    the minor, successful completion of the language sequence is required by the fall of junior year, 
    but students are strongly encouraged to do so by the spring of their sophomore year. Applications 
    to the minor program are accepted until the end of spring of junior year.

    Students must successfully take a minimum of five courses in the relevant language, linguistics, 
    literature or culture, excluding courses that do not have a language prerequisite and any 
    100-level language course. At least three of these courses must be at the 300 level (or higher). 
    Up to two of these courses may be taken at the 200 level, but ITA 207 and 208, cannot both be counted. 
    A 200-level course is a prerequisite for taking 300-level courses in Italian.

      At the end of their senior year, students must successfully pass a 10-minute exit interview with 
      a panel of three faculty members. The interview will consist in a conversation reassessing the 
      student's experience within the department, with the purpose of assessing their proficiency in 
      Italian.
