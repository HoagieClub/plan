description: 
  The Program in Judaic Studies provides students the opportunity to
  explore more than three millennia of Jewish culture, history, religion,
  thought, politics and literature from the Bible to contemporary Jewish
  thought and society. A wide variety of courses, lectures, conferences,
  film series and exhibitions taking advantage of Princeton's rich
  resources in Judaic studies are offered. There is no "typical" Judaic
  studies minor student; we serve students with a wide range of interests
  and welcome all who are motivated to deepen their knowledge of Judaic
  studies.

  explanation: 
    A sound program of study will involve both historical range and disciplinary
    breadth. Each student's course of study must be approved by the Judaic studies
    director. The minor requirements are compatible with a major in any humanities
    or social sciences department. All courses offered by Judaic studies or
    cross-listed with JDS may be considered preapproved to count toward the
    Judaic studies minor. Any other course requires explicit approval by the JDS
    director. One advanced (300-level) Hebrew course may count toward the course
    requirements if approved by the JDS director. Students will be allowed to use
    up to two course requirements for the Judaic studies minor to count toward
    their major.

      Alternatively, students can (a) successfully complete four courses
      (including JDS 202) approved to count toward the Judaic studies minor, 
      and (b) write a senior thesis in their major department that engages
      an issue or issues in Judaic studies over a substantial portion of
      the thesis (the thesis topic must be submitted to the director of
      the JDS minor for approval).

    Toward the end of their senior year, students in the Judaic studies
    minor come together at a capstone event to present some of their 
    Judaic studies research to one another and faculty members, discuss
    their work and respond to questions. If a student has taken Pathway 1,
    their presentation would typically be drawn from Judaic studies work
    they have done over the course of pursuing the minor; if a student has
    taken Pathway 2, their presentation would typically be drawn from their
    senior thesis. The subject matter and form of a presentation should be
    decided in discussion with the Judaic studies director. Everyone in the
    University's Judaic studies community is invited to this event, and
    non-seniors in the Judaic studies minor are especially encouraged to
    attend.
