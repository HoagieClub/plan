description: The purpose of the Religion Minor is to provide an interdisciplinary framework in which students majoring in other departments can synthesize their coursework in religious studies to most effectively enrich their other academic work. This framework orients students’ personal, pre-professional, and scholarly interests in thinking about religion toward comparative cultural and social contexts. Students who complete the minor will leave Princeton with a better understanding of the artistic, economic, ethical, historical, philosophical, and political effects of religious traditions and religious thought.

      At least four of these courses must be offered by the Department of Religion. One course may be 
      offered elsewhere in the University, as long as it is approved as suitably relevant by the DUS. 
      Courses cross-listed with REL may be considered pre-approved.

    explanation: |-
      The five courses should not all be focused on a single religious tradition or approach, nor should they 
      all be focused on different traditions or approaches. That is, the five courses must include courses from 
      at least two of the five “Areas of Study” in which the Department of Religion offers courses and  two (or more) 
      courses from one of those five areas. The five Areas of Study are Ancient Judaism, Christianity, and Greek and 
      Roman Religions; Islam; Religion in the Americas; Religions of Asia; and Philosophical and Ethical Approaches to 
      Religion.

  max_counted: 1

  explanation: |-
    Upon completion of the minor’s course requirements, students will participate in a research symposium and present 
    their work to each other, the Religion majors, and members of the Religion faculty. Participating students will organize
    these symposia at the end of each academic year with the assistance of the DUS and the Undergrad Administrator. Each participating student 
    will present on a research project of their choice. It is anticipated that these will take the form of poster presentations, 
    but the Department is open to other formats that would respond to a given minor cohort’s interest and initiative. 
    Students are encouraged to present on a paper that they completed as part of one of their courses in the minor, but those desiring 
    other options are encouraged to discuss them with the DUS. All students in the minor are encouraged to seek the advice of relevant faculty in 
    putting together their presentations.

  explanation: |-
    Minors are required to submit a Reflection Paper after completing the course and conference requirements for the minor. 
    This short (2-3 page) paper will narrate the student’s coursework in the minor with particular focus on how that work has
    related to their work in their major and/or other aspects of their time at Princeton.

  explanation: |-
    No more than one elected P/D/F course may be counted towards the requirements for the minor.
    
    No double-counting of courses is permitted: students may not count a course toward the Religion Minor that they are counting toward their major.
