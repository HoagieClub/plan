  through diverse coursework and engaging extra-curricular activities. You’ll explore European history, 
  literature, art, architecture, music, cinema, theater, politics, sociology, economy, and philosophy, 
  covering various time periods and national contexts, and develop skills in critical thinking, cultural 
  analysis, and interdisciplinary research.

    One of the following core courses is required as a prerequisite: ECS 301 or EPS 302. Students who are 
    unable to take either ECS 301 or EPS 302 may petition the directors for other courses that offer an 
    introduction to the study of Europe from a similarly interdisciplinary point, such as HUM 216-217, 
    HUM 218-219, or HIS 212/EPS 212.

    In addition to the prerequisite course, students will be required to take four elective courses in ECS or EPS; 
    at least one of these courses should be in ECS and one in EPS, core or cross-listed. Students who have taken a 
    full year of the double-credit HUM 216-217 and HUM 218-219 (the Western Humanities Sequence) satisfy two of the 
    elective courses. Students who have taken one semester of the double-credit HUM 216-217 or HUM 218-219 satisfy 
    one of the elective courses.

  explanation: |-
    For a period of 6-8 weeks during the senior year, EUS seniors meet once a week to address common problems 
    of research, conceptualization, organization, and writing under the supervision of the directors of the 
    minor. In advance of each weekly session, two or three students submit a sample of their thesis work for 
    close, critical reading by all members of the colloquium. During the sessions, students make introductory 
    presentations of their projects, followed by discussions of the submitted work. Active participation in 
    discussion is expected of all members of the colloquium each week. Students from the natural sciences or 
    engineering who do not address European topics in their theses may submit a paper written for an EUS course 
    for circulation and discussion, or they may opt to share material drawn from their thesis research and discuss 
    aspects of their projects that intersect with the broader concerns of the colloquium.
