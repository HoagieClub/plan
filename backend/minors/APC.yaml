description: At Princeton, the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics offers a small group of undergraduate 
  students the unique opportunity to gain exposure to the philosophy and tools of modern applied and computational 
  mathematics in an interactive and interdisciplinary environment. The program is open to students from across campus 
  who are looking to broaden their mathematical and computational skills. Students who complete the program requirements 
  are awarded a Minor in Applied and Computational Mathematics.

    The course requirement may be satisfied by a broad range of courses that place particular emphasis in applied 
    mathematics, which are offered by the mathematics department and by science, engineering, and economics departments.
    The five required courses must be distributed between the following two areas: Mathematical Foundations and Mathematical
    Applications.

    An independent research project consisting of a paper in one of the following formats: (a) a project that you are working 
    on with a professor; or (b) a summer research project. The research project may not be used to satisfy any requirements 
    of your major or of any other minor or certificate. Most (but not all) majors require a senior thesis and/or junior 
    independent work, which therefore cannot be used as such for PACM; however, a significant extension of such independent 
    work could be used for PACM subject to approval of the PACM undergraduate representative.

    Students are required to participate during the spring semester of their junior and senior years in a not-for-credit 
    colloquium offered by PACM. This will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of research projects among all 
    students in the minor and will introduce them to a broad range of areas within applied mathematics.
