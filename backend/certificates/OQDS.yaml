  The Certificate Program in Optimization and Quantitative Decision Science
  (OQDS) is focused on developing quantitative skills for optimal decision-making in
  complex and uncertain environments. Through this certificate program, students will
  learn to quantify risk and uncertainty and to view any complex decision through the
  lens of mathematical optimization. This outlook will give them a more structured
  understanding of the decision itself, as they learn to rigorously formulate their
  constraints, objective function(s) and the uncertainties involved. It will also lead
  students to the proper algorithmic tools that are needed to arrive at an optimal decision.<br><br>

  The certificate program may be of interest to students in engineering, the sciences
  and the liberal arts who wish to pursue analytical thinking and quantitative reasoning
  for the purpose of decision-making under uncertainty. Emphasis is placed on rigorous
  modeling and analysis, taking advantage of the vast flow of data and ubiquitous
  computing power available today.

    <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    A senior thesis or project must be completed and submitted to the program
    director (oqds@princeton.edu) that demonstrates a command of some portion of the core
    disciplines of uncertainty analysis and/or optimization. Students in engineering departments
    that require a one-semester project can typically use a suitably designed project to satisfy
    the requirement.<br><br>

    Acceptable theses can be on a wide range of topics, but they must demonstrate a command of the
    core disciplines of the OQDS certificate program, including stochastics and/or optimization.
    The thesis must demonstrate, in appropriate mathematics, the ability to model a problem and
    perform analysis that leads to some conclusion or scientific result. A thesis with minimal
    or no mathematical modeling is not acceptable.<br><br>

    Theses that do not qualify include "soft" topics such as the history of a nation's economy,
    and hard-science theses (laboratory-based theses) that do not have a significant modeling
    or data-analysis component (for example, collecting observations and computing basic
    statistics is not sufficient).
