    <i>Editor's Note: Students may complete this requirement without enrolling in any numbered course, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    A piece of independent work. This can be satisfied in several ways:<br>
    (a) by a substantial paper growing out of one of the courses taken to fulfill the certificate
    requirement (this will be in addition to the work required in the course);<br>
    (b) by a substantial independent paper advised by a member of the Classics faculty; or<br>
    (c) with the agreement of the home department and Classics DUS, by a piece of independent
    work that satisfies the requirements of both Classics and the home department.<br><br> 
    
    As a substitute for this requirement, students may take either an additional course in their
    language (CLG or LAT) at the 200- or 300-level or a CLA course focusing on the culture of
    their certificate program (Greek or Roman).
