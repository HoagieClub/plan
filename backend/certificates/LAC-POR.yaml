  description: Department Requirement
  explanation: "Three department-based POR courses above the 100-level on the literature
  and cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world. At least one of these three courses
  must be at the 200-level. No course taught in English can count towards the certificate.
  Courses must be taken for a letter grade, no Pass/D/Fail or Audit. **Due to the COVID-19
  pandemic, spring '20 and academic year '20-'21 courses taken PDF will be accepted.** 
  At the discretion of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, students who study abroad
  during the academic year may count one pre-approved course per semester abroad towards
  the certificate. One Princeton summer abroad course offered through the department would
  also count, provided that it is taught in Portuguese. Two pre-approved courses in a summer
  program abroad other than Princeton's can count as one course towards the certificate,
  provided that they are taught in Portuguese. In no case, however, can more than one
  course taken abroad count towards the certificate."

  # TODO: I understood the description to mean that at least 1 has to be 200-level and not higher, but that seems odd?
