description: "The program is open to all undergraduates in all departments.
Ordinarily, students majoring in language and literature departments, including
comparative literature, will be eligible for the certificate in language and culture
provided that: (a) the linguistic base for the language and culture certificate is
different from the linguistic base of the major; and (b) the work required for the
language and culture certificate does not duplicate the requirements of the major.

Students pursuing area studies certificates may earn the certificate in language
and culture provided that (a) the courses they elect to satisfy the requirements
of the area studies program are different from those they elect to satisfy the
requirements of the language and culture certificate program (in agreement with
the Program in Latin American Studies, one course can be used towards both a
certificate in Spanish or Portuguese and a certificate in Latin American Studies;
and (b) they submit a piece of independent work in addition to the independent work
that satisfies the requirements of each area studies program."

  description: Department Requirement
  explanation: "Three department-based POR courses above the 100-level on the literature
  and cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world. At least one of these three courses
  must be at the 200-level. No course taught in English can count towards the certificate.
  Courses must be taken for a letter grade, no Pass/D/Fail or Audit. **Due to the COVID-19
  pandemic, spring '20 and academic year '20-'21 courses taken PDF will be accepted.** 
  At the discretion of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, students who study abroad
  during the academic year may count one pre-approved course per semester abroad towards
  the certificate. One Princeton summer abroad course offered through the department would
  also count, provided that it is taught in Portuguese. Two pre-approved courses in a summer
  program abroad other than Princeton's can count as one course towards the certificate,
  provided that they are taught in Portuguese. In no case, however, can more than one
  course taken abroad count towards the certificate."

  # TODO: I understood the description to mean that at least 1 has to be 200-level and not higher, but that seems odd?
