description: The Program in Architecture and Engineering enables students to work
  at the intersection of engineering and architecture.  It is a framework for interdisciplinary
  study to tackle problems that cannot be addressed by one discipline. The certificate
  is an opportunity to respond dynamically to evolving global challenges, where elegant
  and effective solutions lead to more resilient and sustainable communities.
