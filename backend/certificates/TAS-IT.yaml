description: |-
  One would be hard-pressed to find any aspect of society today
  that is not influenced by evolving technology in a significant way. Similarly,
  technology does not develop in a vacuum; by virtue of its applied nature, it is
  shaped by the needs and desires of individuals and the societies in which they
  live. Society and technology co-evolve, so that you cannot fully understand one
  without knowing something about the other. This cross-disciplinary certificate
  program is targeted to students, both engineers/scientists and humanists/social
  scientists, who are interested in exploring this intersection in depth. Graduates
  who earn this certificate will be effective contributors to the shaping, development
  and deployment of technological solutions for the benefit of society.<br><br>

  The intersection of technology and society is broad, touching on a wide range of
  technologies and on a variety of societal issues and concerns. To ensure depth,
  individual programs of study are offered along two technology tracks:
  Information Technology and Energy.<br><br>

  The Information Technology track is offered in partnership between the Keller Center
  and the Center for Information Technology Policy through spring 2026. Students graduating
  in 2025 and 2026 will be managed by CITP. Students graduating in 2027 and 2028 will be
  managed by the Keller Center. Information technology (IT) broadly covers the computation
  and communication technologies that permeate virtually all aspects of corporate and social
  activity. The products and services enabled by it have had a major impact on the world
  economy and on social interactions. As we look to the future, emerging technologies in
  IT continue to address critical societal challenges such as economic development, health
  care, politics, education, productivity, government and social organization. At the same
  time, these technologies raise new challenges in security, law enforcement, privacy,
  economic stability and justice.

    <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    All students are required to undertake a one-semester independent research
    project in IT and society. This can be done four ways:
    1) Taking the COS IW - Technology Policy seminar or SPIA Policy Task Force seminar taught by
    CITP Clinic Lead Mihir Kshirsagar. (Please note these courses are open only to juniors of
    COS or SPIA students and are listed on the semester by course webpage.)
    2) Including the T&S IW research as part of a student's junior paper.
    3) Including a chapter or two of the student's senior thesis devoted to the T&S IW research.
    4) Performing IW solely for the T&S certificate program.<br><br>

    Please note that independent work must include research of a technology that relates to
    society. We expect independent work by students from technical disciplines to engage
    directly with the sociological, humanistic, or policy components of the technology
    in question. Please note that essentially all of computer science and engineering is 
    ultimately motivated by the betterment of society, but that is not sufficient by itself.
    Independent work must explore the interface between technology and society.
