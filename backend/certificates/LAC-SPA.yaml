different from the linguistic base of the major; and (b) the work required for the
language and culture certificate does not duplicate the requirements of the major.

Students pursuing area studies certificates may earn the certificate in language
and culture provided that (a) the courses they elect to satisfy the requirements
of the area studies program are different from those they elect to satisfy the
requirements of the language and culture certificate program (in agreement with
the Program in Latin American Studies, one course can be used towards both a
certificate in Spanish or Portuguese and a certificate in Latin American Studies;
and (b) they submit a piece of independent work in addition to the independent work
that satisfies the requirements of each area studies program."

  explanation: "Four department-based or cross-listed SPA courses above SPA 209,
  at least three of which must be 300-level (or higher) in Spanish language,
  literature, or culture. Courses must be taken for a letter grade, no Pass/D/Fail
  or Audit. **Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, spring '20 and academic year '20-'21
  courses taken PDF will be accepted.** At the discretion of the Director of Undergraduate
  Studies, students who study abroad during the academic year may count one pre-approved
  course per semester abroad towards the certificate. One Princeton summer abroad course
  offered through the department would also count. Two pre-approved courses in a summer
  program abroad other than Princeton's can count as one course towards the certificate.
  In no case, however, can more than two courses taken abroad count toward the certificate.
  A maximum of one course taught in English may be counted towards the certificate,
  provided that all written work is submitted in Spanish."
