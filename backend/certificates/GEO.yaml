type: Certificate
name: Geological Engineering
code: GEO
degree:
description: Depending upon the selection of electives, the program
prepares students for graduate study or practice in geology, geochemistry,
geophysics, oceanography, water resources, engineering and environmental
geology, and civil and environmental engineering. The program is a
cooperative effort of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
and the Department of Geosciences, and the program committee is drawn from
those departments. The student may be a candidate for either the B.S.E. or
the A.B. degree.

          Computer proficiency is a requirement for the B.S.E. degree fulfilled by taking COS 126 General Computer Science or ECE 115 Introduction to Computing: Programming Autonomous Vehicles. Students with adequate preparation as determined by the Department of Computer Science may substitute COS 217 Introduction to Programming Systems or COS 226 Algorithms and Data Structures. This requirement must be satisfied before the beginning of the junior year. This requirement may not be satisfied by a course taken under the Pass/D/Fail option. A course taken at another school may not be used to satisfy this requirement.

  explanation: Four program-approved courses at or above the 300 level
  that constitute a coherent sequence (for additional details, see the geosciences
  and civil and environmental engineering department descriptions). At least
  two of these courses must be from a department different from that in which
  the student is majoring.
