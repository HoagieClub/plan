type: Certificate
name: Robotics and Intelligent Systems
code: RIS
degree:
description: New industries and organizations depend increasingly on the interplay
  between engineering, computing, and the life sciences. Innovations and inventions
  require multidisciplinary approaches and entrepreneurship, as well as grounding
  in theory and practice, in topics that may not be covered by a single department.
  The program offers an integrated set of core and elective courses, introducing students
  to fundamental concepts, providing depth in specific fields of interest, and setting
  the stage for further achievement. Students are encouraged to expand their experience
  through summer internships with companies, government agencies, and university laboratories.

    <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    A one-term senior independent work project or two-term senior
    thesis whose topic is relevant to robotics and intelligent systems must be
    completed and presented to the program committee. Junior independent work
    projects do not fulfill the certificate requirement. A minimum grade of
    B- for the project or thesis is required to qualify for the certificate.
