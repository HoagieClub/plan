type: Certificate
name: Robotics and Intelligent Systems
code: RIS
degree:
description: New industries and organizations depend increasingly on the interplay
  between engineering, computing, and the life sciences. Innovations and inventions
  require multidisciplinary approaches and entrepreneurship, as well as grounding
  in theory and practice, in topics that may not be covered by a single department.
  The program offers an integrated set of core and elective courses, introducing students
  to fundamental concepts, providing depth in specific fields of interest, and setting
  the stage for further achievement. Students are encouraged to expand their experience
  through summer internships with companies, government agencies, and university laboratories.
