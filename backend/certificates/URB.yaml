description: The Certificate Program in Urban Studies is an interdepartmental plan
  of study for undergraduates that offers an interdisciplinary framework for the study
  of cities, metropolitan regions, and urban and suburban landscapes. With courses
  in diverse department, the program encourages students to think about metropolitan
  centers in all their complexity as physical spaces; social, cultural, political,
  and economic nexuses; and historical artifacts.

  explanation: Students must take URB 201 Introduction to Urban Studies, or with
    approval of the director, an urban-focused elective such as URB 388.
    Students must also take a design studio course, either ARC 205 or ARC 204.
    Students planning to major in architecture or CEE are directed to ARC 204.
    Note that studio courses are limited in size; students are encouraged to fulfill
    the studio course requirement as soon as their schedule permits. The core courses
    are designed to be accessible to all majors. To satisfy the core course
    requirements, students must pass both required courses with a grade of B or above.

  explanation: "In addition to the two core courses, students must complete
    three electives: one from social sciences; one from the humanities; and one
    from engineering or the natural sciences. A list of approved electives is
    posted on the website. Elective courses may vary from year to year and
    students should consult the registrar listing for URB designated courses.
    Courses not on the approved list may be used as electives with the approval
    of the program director. However, each selected course must contain substantial
    urban content to fulfill the requirements of the certificate program."

    <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    While urban studies students' senior theses or projects
    are directed in their home departments, their work must contain an
    urban component, approved by the program director. A faculty member
    from the student's home department serves as the primary adviser and
    first reader. An urban studies adviser may be selected from the
    program's associated faculty list(Link is external) to provide additional
    consultation and layer of expertise as students write and think about potentially
    urban-related careers. The thesis title and abstract must be sent to the
    program director for final approval.
