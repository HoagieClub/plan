description: The Program in Teacher Preparation is an interdepartmental course of
study for undergraduates and is composed of a unique combination of coursework and
clinical experiences in schools at every level of the program. Graduate students
and alumni are eligible to complete it.

The program, approved by the New Jersey Department of Education and by the Council
for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation, allows students to explore education
as a career choice and provides the option to become fully prepared and certified
to teach successfully at the middle and secondary levels within the regular
framework of a Princeton A.B. or B.S.E.

  explanation: "In order to become well-rounded educators, program students are required
  to demonstrate proficiency in a variety of academic disciplines within the liberal arts
  and sciences curriculum. A course is required in each of the following areas: humanities,
  mathematics, science and social science. Courses taken to fulfill the University
  distribution requirements will cover all of these areas."

  max_counted: 0
  min_needed: 0
  explanation: Teaching area requirements normally correspond to departmental major
  requirements. With careful choice of elective courses it is possible to be certified
  to teach in one field while majoring in another. A minimum of eight courses related
  to the area of certification are required, with three of the eight courses at the
  advanced level (300- or 400 level for all areas except mathematics, which requires
  three courses at the 200 level or above). Specific areas of certification may include
  additional requirements or prescribed areas of study in the coursework, and students
  should consult the Teacher Prep Handbook for more information.

  explanation: The practicum consists of participation in three one-hour seminar
  sessions and 18 observation hours in school settings. Three brief written
  assignments and selected readings are also required. The Introductory Practicum
  is designed as a non-credit independent study to accommodate the student's and
  the instructor's schedules and is considered the final step in the application
  process.

  max_counted: 0

  explanation: The Professional Portfolio is a collection of artifacts and evidence
  gathered throughout the program, which, along with written reflections, document
  the student's progress in their professional skill development and ultimately
  provide a demonstrated proficiency in the New Jersey Professional Standards for
  Teachers. The portfolio is evaluated at three checkpoints. The first evaluation
  occurs at the end of the semester just prior to the beginning of TPP 403 and
  TPP 404, and the candidate must receive a “Pass” on the portfolio evaluation by
  their adviser in order to begin Practice Teaching. A second review by the adviser
  takes place prior to the start of the TPP 405 and TPP 406 student teaching courses,
  and a "Pass" is required to continue in those courses. The final review is a formal
  defense of the portfolio that occurs upon completion of TPP 406. The defense must
  be successfully completed before the student's application for certification can be
  submitted to the New Jersey Department of Education. The portfolio must receive a
  "Pass" by a majority of reviewers for the program to recommend the student for state
  licensure. In addition, students will be required to successfully pass a performance
  assessment and the appropriate Praxis subject area tests in order to earn a New Jersey
  teaching license.
