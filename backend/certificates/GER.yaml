    Four courses at the 200 level or higher, at least two of which must
    be at the 300 level or higher. All courses must be taken for a grade (not pass/D/fail).<br><br>
    
    Evidence of substantial upper-level coursework in German. This requirement
    will be satisfied if three of the four courses taken for the certificate were
    conducted in German, or if two were taught in German and one was conducted in English
    with a substantial German-language component. This option is available for all courses 
    taught in the German department as well as courses in other departments cross-listed
    with German. Students should consult with the course instructor regarding the
    German-language component at the beginning of the semester and submit the agreed-upon
    plan to the director of undergraduate studies in German for approval by the end
    of the second week of classes.

    <i>Editor's Note: If using option 1, students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    There are three ways to fulfill the certificate independent work requirement:<br>
    1. Complete a substantial paper (15-20 pages if in English, 10-15 pages if in German),
    which may be a revised version of a paper written for one of the four required courses.<br>
    2. Write a chapter from the senior thesis principally devoted to a German-related topic.<br>
    3. Complete an additional 300-level class taught in German.
