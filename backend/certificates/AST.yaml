description: |-
Unraveling the origins of life on Earth and determining whether life
exists beyond Earth will likely be two of the most significant scientific discoveries
in the 21st century. The Program in Planets and Life is an interdepartmental,
multidisciplinary plan of study designed for students interested in these two
questions. The goal is to provide students with an understanding of the fundamental
astrophysical, chemical, biological and geological principles and engineering
challenges that will guide our search for life in extreme environments on Earth
and on other planets and satellites in the solar system and among neighboring
planetary systems. Research on and teaching of these topics are typically performed
under the rubric of astrobiology.<br><br>

The program will equip participating students with the skills they will require to
assume leadership roles in discovering the origins of terrestrial and extraterrestrial
life over the next decades. The cooperating departments from which the Program in
Planets and Life draws faculty and other resources include astrophysics, chemistry,
ecology and evolutionary biology, geosciences, mechanical and aerospace engineering,
and operations research and financial engineering, as well as the Princeton School of
Public and International Affairs.

- name: Core Course
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: Students must take the core course GEO 255/AST 255/EEB 255/CHM 255.
  This course will qualify for departmental credit if the student submits a 25-page
  term paper on astrobiology, with the emphasis in that department's discipline.

- name: Cognate Courses
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 4
  explanation: Students must take an additional four cognate courses. Only two
  of the cognate courses can be in the student's major or be requirements of
  their majors (though exceptions can be considered on a case-by-case basis).
  The cognate courses must be approved by the program chairperson, and students
  are encouraged to discuss their choices in the early stages of their planning.

    <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>
    
    To qualify for the certificate, A.B. students must (a) write at least one 
    of the junior papers on an astrobiology topic and, as part of the senior thesis,
    (b) devote a chapter to an astrobiology topic — both of them subject to approval by
    the program director in consultation with executive committee members. Engineering
    students must devote one chapter of their senior independent work to an astrobiology
    topic — again subject to approval by the program chairperson in consultation with
    executive committee members. The relevant content of the student's senior thesis or
    senior independent work will be presented at a special Planets and Life Symposium at
    the end of senior year. Juniors are also encouraged to participate in this yearly
    Planets and Life Symposium.
