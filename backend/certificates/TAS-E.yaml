description: |-
  One would be hard-pressed to find any aspect of society today
  that is not influenced by evolving technology in a significant way. Similarly,
  technology does not develop in a vacuum; by virtue of its applied nature, it is
  shaped by the needs and desires of individuals and the societies in which they
  live. Society and technology co-evolve, so that you cannot fully understand one
  without knowing something about the other. This cross-disciplinary certificate
  program is targeted to students, both engineers/scientists and humanists/social
  scientists, who are interested in exploring this intersection in depth. Graduates
  who earn this certificate will be effective contributors to the shaping, development
  and deployment of technological solutions for the benefit of society.<br><br>

  The intersection of technology and society is broad, touching on a wide range of
  technologies and on a variety of societal issues and concerns. To ensure depth,
  individual programs of study are offered along two technology tracks:
  Information Technology and Energy.<br><br>

  The Energy track is offered in partnership between the Keller Center and the
  Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. Provision and use of energy and
  atural resources in a sustainable way is the single biggest challenge for Americans
  and citizens of the world to preserve the planet for future generations. Our economic
  and national security as well as our overall ability to thrive as a society depends
  on living within our resources. Rapid economic and technological growth throughout
  the world is causing unprecedented demands for energy. Determining how to meet these
  needs while protecting the environment is one of the most pressing challenges of our
  times. These problems are complex and intertwined, not only involving a need for
  advances in science and engineering, but also requiring changes in human behavior,
  economic analyses and innovations in institutions as well as thoughtful policy.

    <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    All students are required to undertake a one-semester independent
    research project in Energy. For A.B. students, this includes a junior paper. This
    may be substituted by a significant component in their senior thesis (at least a
    chapter). The project/thesis component requires preapproval of the student's program
    advisor.
