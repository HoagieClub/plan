## Summary of Discrepancies

### Programs with Incorrect Course Counts

1. **Minors Showing Too Few Courses Needed**
   - AAS: Shows 4, needs 5 (missing GRE requirement)
   - ARA: Shows 2, needs 5 (language sequence not counted properly)
   - ART: Shows 2, needs 5 (not counting all required courses)
   - CHI: Shows 3, needs 7 (language sequence not counted properly)
   - CLA: Shows 4, needs 5 (track requirements not properly counted)
   - CWR: Shows 2, needs 5 (not counting all required courses)
   - EAS: Shows 4, needs 7 (language sequence not counted properly)
   - ENG: Shows 2, needs 5 (not counting all required courses)
   - ENV: Shows 4, needs 5 (distribution requirements not counted properly)
   - FRE: Shows 4, needs 5 (advanced level requirements not counted)
   - HLS: Shows 3, needs 5 (breadth requirements not counted properly)
   - JPN: Shows 3, needs 7 (language sequence not counted properly)
   - KOR: Shows 3, needs 7 (language sequence not counted properly)
   - LAS: Shows 1, needs 4 (not counting required courses after language)
   - NES: Shows 3, needs 5 (content course requirements not counted properly)

2. **Minors Showing Too Many Courses Needed**
   - DAN: Shows 7, needs 6 (not crediting DAN 225 properly)
   - ENE: Shows 7, needs 5 (double-counting some requirements)
   - EUS: Shows 7, needs 5 (double-counting elective requirements)
   - HOA: Shows 8, needs 5 (distribution areas counted separately)
   - JDS: Shows 9, needs 5 (not handling path options correctly)
   - MQE: Shows 8, needs 6 (prerequisites being counted twice)

3. **Special Cases**
   - PHY: Shows 0, needs 1-5 (path selection logic failing)
     - Not properly handling OR conditions between paths
     - Engineering course substitutions not counted correctly
     - Math prerequisites possibly double-counted

### Common Patterns in Incorrect Counts

1. **Language Program Issues**
   - Pattern: Language minors consistently show fewer courses than needed
   - Affected Programs: ARA, CHI, JPN, KOR, FRE
   - Root Cause: Language sequence requirements not properly tracked
   - Fix Needed: Implement proper language level progression tracking

2. **Path Selection Problems**
   - Pattern: Programs with multiple paths show incorrect minimums
   - Affected Programs: CLA, JDS
   - Root Cause: Logic not properly finding minimum valid path
   - Fix Needed: Implement path analysis algorithm

3. **Prerequisite Handling**
   - Pattern: Prerequisites sometimes double-counted or ignored
   - Affected Programs: MQE, DAN, ENE
   - Root Cause: Unclear rules about prerequisite counting
   - Fix Needed: Standardize prerequisite handling

4. **Distribution Requirements**
   - Pattern: Area/breadth requirements not properly tracked
   - Affected Programs: HOA, HLS, ENV
   - Root Cause: Distribution tracking logic incomplete
   - Fix Needed: Implement proper distribution requirement tracking

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Language Program Logic**
   - Create dedicated language sequence tracker
   - Track language levels separately from regular courses
   - Implement proper prerequisite chains
   - Handle language placement tests and equivalencies

2. **Path Analysis**
   - Implement explicit path tracking
   - Calculate minimum courses across all paths
   - Use minimum valid path length
   - Handle OR conditions properly

3. **Prerequisite Management**
   - Create clear prerequisite rules
   - Track prerequisites separately
   - Handle course equivalencies
   - Prevent double-counting where inappropriate

4. **Distribution Requirements**
   - Track distribution areas properly
   - Handle cross-listed courses
   - Implement area requirement minimums
   - Track breadth requirements separately

5. **Cross-listing Handling**
   - Create comprehensive cross-listing database
   - Implement course equivalency checking
   - Consider all possible course codes
   - Handle departmental variants

6. **Requirement Tree Analysis**
   - Review nested requirement counting
   - Implement better OR/AND conditions
   - Add requirement tree validation
