Comments: ['Just get through it', "Very much asynchronous learning - don't expect everything to be covered in lectures or precepts.", "I thought the course was pretty fun and definitely not a big time commitment. The written exams were the hardest parts, but if you study hard for 3 or 4 days before the exam they're super doable. The online lectures and textbook seem boring, but you don't need to do them since you learn everything you need in precept.", 'I would tell students to get started on assignments early because there is plenty of time and it will pay off.', "Skim the book before watching the videos, practice practice practice, and go to office hours. If you are new to the course good luck because it's very intimidating being grouped with the same people who have been coding since the womb.", "If you can, start the assignments early in order to get help from the Lab TAs before it gets slammed. Also, go to office hours if you need more help with the assignments. Don't worry too much about the lectures, they are better as a supplement. Precept exercises provide more useful insight and preparation.", "Good intro cos class, if you're confused about a topic definitely ask your preceptor. I took the 50 minute precept with some prior python experience and I thought it was fine. The 80 minute precept definitely won't hurt if you want to get a solid understanding of the material.", 'If you have taken APCS or equivalent, take the RPI precept!', 'about what I expected', 'This course is time consuming but rewarding!', 'I would highly recommend this course to any student considering it. The overall quality of the course, including the lectures, readings, visuals, and class dynamics, is exceptional.', '...', 'This is a great course that requires a decent amount of time commitment but is ultimately very rewarding. If you have not coded at all or only coded a little bit, you will be surprised by how vastly your coding skills improve. If you ever get stuck on an assignment, office hours and Lab TAs are incredibly helpful. For the conceptual aspect of the course, be sure to watch the lecture videos at a minimum and complete the readings as often as possible. Be aware the content is often presented at a level that exceeds the course itself, so do not worry if you do not always get everything. Utilize office hours and practice exams when you are preparing for the exams, and you will do well.', "I took this course as someone with no coding background, which put me behind a little. The course is not really an introductory course and if you're in a similar situation, you will need to do a good amount of outside work in order to understand what's going on. The lecture videos were not good - Sedgewick just reads off the slides, glosses over important concepts, and is not good at explaining. TAs are helpful, but my precept was filled with people who had background knowledge (even though I was at an 80 minute precept), and the TA would assume that everyone was moving at the same pace, which was not true. Office hours and lab TA hours are very helpful - definitely use those. Start on assignments early (like Thurs) so you have enough time to ask for help if you need it. It is doable with no background in coding, but don't expect a ton of support from the lectures and precepts themselves.", "Read if:--You are NOT required to take this course--You are taking it out of interest--You are taking other heavy STEM courses this semesterIf you checked any of these three, don't take this class. Don't get me wrong, this class has a ton of resources and avenues for help, but these can only be used if you have the time. If COS126 can't be the hardest class of your semester, avoid it. For anyone taking this course, in general: watch out for the post-add/drop period spike. Hello World and Loops (if you start early) are the only assignments you experience before add/drop. After Loops--which was a fair and manageable assignment--you can't switch out of the course and then they throw this crazy N-Body assignment at you. The pacing and difficulty after add/drop absolutely skyrocket and it's ridiculous. Still can't wrap my head around why these instructors are tricking students into staying in this class when 300+ are required to take it anyway.Survival tips if you're stuck in the class: --You get to drop one programming assignment and I highly recommend dropping Image Classifier. That is hands down the hardest one.--Get Mikako Inaba as a preceptor if you can. She was fantastic.--Pray that at least your partner knows what's going on when you get into partner assignments.--For us, the second written exam was wild. Our average was a 71.5/100, while the average for the first written exam was an 84.1/100. The second written exam is lowkey random coding concepts so study up for that one.--Don't stress too much over the programming exams. They're really generous with partial credit on the second one.", 'Make sure you stay on top of the video lectures every week. You can still do well in the class without watching a lot of them, but your time will feel better spent going to precepts if you have watched the video lectures before hand, or else you will likely be learning the material while you do the actual assignment. Also, go to lab TA hours to work on the assignments there so that you can ask questions when you have them. And start assignments early, because they will take a long time.', 'Go to office hours and lab TA hours.', 'good', 'This course is very manageable for both AB and BSE students, I recommend taking even if you have experience with Java!

Attend Lab TA office hours to do weekly assignments and the textbook often has valuable methods that you can replicate. Not very beginner friendly, but if you took COS in HS you'll be fine for most of the course.", "Head instructors are often unhelpful or unresponsive if you ask them questions on Ed (the discussion board they encourage everyone to use). You're likely better off just emailing your preceptor directly if you have any questions about the assignments or course material.", "Great course, fun assignments, definitely take it! In today's world, the knowledge that this class gives you is essential. I like how the professors relate the content to so many different real-world applications. If you already know how to code the first half of the course will be pretty easy. The second half is more theoretical and was unknown to me before, so I learned a lot there.", 'Go to PRECEPT, and get Max (Brian) as your preceptor or Mikako. They are both amazing preceptors. This class is very time consuming, so if an assignment is taking you long to finish I would recommend going to Lab TAs or office hours because those are life savers. The class is a good class to learn the basics of java coding, however, its again a time commitment but if you are ready I would recommend.', "Go to Lab TA's they will save you!", 'I would say try not to fall behind on readings/lectures. Save yourself the trouble by looking at the slides they use during lectures.', "If you've ever done computer science before in high school, most concepts in the first half of the semester should be easy. You will most likely have to work a bit to understand theory-based concepts, but it is very doable. I have a five class semester (two stem and two humanities), and this class is very balanced in terms of difficulty. I won't recommend taking this class as a fifth, but do consider taking it as your third or fourth most time commitment class.", "This course gives a good introduction to computer science. It can be tough for students with no background in computer science, but Lab TA and Office Hours are super helpful if you're struggling with an assignment. I think that computer science is a good skill for everyone to have a basis of knowledge of.", 'This is a very fun and engaging course! Take it and you will love it.', "It's a good learning course, but it is quite demanding, so if a BSE student with no coding experience, you just kind of have to accept a bad semester with other prerequisites, but if you can, I would recommend if you have no experience like me taking this course with an easier course load. I think I would have enjoyed the class more and learned more if that was the case.", "This course is really great and it's probably going to be one of your easier classes even if you have no coding experience -- I usually just did the weekly assignment the night before it was due and it was totally fine. Make sure to utilize lab TA office hours if you're struggling with debugging or approaching the assignment.", "Definitely take this class if you're interested in learning how to code! It's very time consuming and stressful if you've never really coded before, but it's well worth it.  Also don't worry if you bomb the first programming exam as it's not worth very much (at least in the semester I took it, it wasn't). Get started on the assignments early in the week - they're due on Sundays, so try to start them before the Thursday lecture. Also, besides exam days, you don't have to go to lecture on Thursday - some of these lectures are helpful, but a lot of them just involve the professor reading the assignment specifications to the class...You will learn a lot about programming if you put in the time and effort. Seanna is a great preceptor!", 'go to office hours for assignments', 'I was scared going into this because I had heard a lot of horror stories from people who had previously taken the course about its difficulty ? but I actually found it extremely fair, and ended up having a lot of fun! I had never coded before in my life, so while the learning curve was pretty steep, there are endless resources available to you and I never felt like I was falling behind. My biggest piece of advice: go to Lab TAs!!!! They are often more organized than office hours, and you generally spend a lot less time waiting for help.', 'Course is worth taking overall if you have an interest in coding. Fairly easy to do well but a bit of a time commitment', "Don't think twice, take it and learn a lot.", 'Take it! Favorite class so far. Assignments are super fun and well structured.', "Don't be intimidated, when they say no prior programming experience is required, they absolutely mean it...Just be ready to learn and you'll be good", "Take it, enjoy it, it's great! The office hours on Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays were fundamental to my (and later my partner's and my) success in completing programming assignments. Also ask questions in precept and participate. Answering a question incorrectly  was actually the most effective way to learn the concept/gain an understanding. No questions is insignificant/dumb/irrelevant, and the preceptors have great ways of explaining things if you simply ask. The programming assignments and written exams make up the bulk of the course, so make sure to let your needs be known to your preceptor, and the class will be a wonderful learning experience - I had never done any coding/programming before taking COS", "Not that hard if you know some COS. Tests are very easy, assignments don't take too long if you follow progress steps and don't search for bugs for hours. Also, assignemnts are actually really interesting.", "the assignments were extremely helpful in boosting my self-confidence in coding in general. took this course without any coding background but was able to finish all the assignments with little to no help within a reasonable time, so i think cos 126 in general is extremely well taught and organized, although sometimes the instructions were unclear and vague. there def is a steep learning curve, but it's managable. also, try not to miss precepts, bc they usually help even if you don't listen to the recorded lectures or don't go to big group lectures. i'd recommend that you read the textbooks though. highly recommend taking it.", 'I would strongly recommend to keep up with the concepts because while it starts easy, it very quickly increases in difficulty. Make sure you are understanding all assignments as you do them.', 'Make sure to review all the material for the Written Exams and take the practice exams! Also find a good partner who matches your skill level for the partnered assignments, so you both can learn together. Go to lab TAs!', "This is an amazing course! Every week we do a different coding project to learn new skills and apply them to different fields, including art and music. I had coded a tiny bit before, but never in Java, and I definitely would say you'll have to spend more time in office hours if you've never coded before. But it's totally ok -- because the lab TAs are INCREDIBLY helpful and will get you through all the projects.", 'Very cool course and you learn a lot. Expect it to be challenging as the concepts usually build off of each other week, but if you approach it with a growth mindset, an A-/A is very attainable for savvy beginners. It\'s key to understand that, even though things may be hard, to never give up on your ability to learn and simply say "Oh well this isn\'t for me," especially if you have a decent semester course-load-wise and can afford to spend ~10 hours on COS  per week between the lectures/assignments/occasional study to prep for exams. Both exam 2s are very hard so try to maximize your score on the first exams to give yourself that cushion! TAKE THIS COURSE!', 'This class is hard. It is a lot of self teaching, and requires lots of work outside of class.', 'Although it will be challenging if you did not take any CS classes in high school, I would totally recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in the subject. Just be prepared to put in some work on the assignments and make sure to study hard for the final written exam (it is much harder than the first!)', 'Take this course as an introduction to programming. Mikako is the goat and I would totally try to get her as a preceptor, especially if you are new to coding. This course is fast paced if you have no experience, but is definitely doable. If you have experience, the first few weeks will be dry but it will pick up fast.', 'I would recommend this course to students with a bit of coding experience. I would take an online coding course before taking COS126.', "Take this course! It teaches the fundamentals well, especially if you've had some prior experience or are willing to put in the effort.", 'Take!', "Really do not take this class unless you have to. Some people might say that it is a good class to take and then PDF, but you'll still have to put in an insane amount of effort to the class to get a C or above. Assignment take 6-15 hours a week, every week to complete. Preceptors suck and are super condescending when you ask for help, plus you might get stuck with a bad one who just turns on the videos during precept instead of teaching. Found it super hard to find anyone to help me actually learn the material and not just help complete an assignment. Really made my semester suck. Do not take these people don't care about you.", 'Preferably have a bit of background knowledge before taking it. Although it is introductory, the pacing is extremely fast and will be a lot easier if you have some knowledge.', "For most of you taking this class, it is required, so you don't have much of an option here. I would definitely recommend not procrastinating on the weekly assignments as they will sometimes be harder than expected, and you won't have enough time to get help. Many students all go to office hours or lab TAs late in the week, so you will have to wait much longer to receive help. For this semester, the programming exams were quite easy, but written exam 2 was absolutely criminal. Go through every past exam to practice for those.", 'Definitely be prepared to put in a lot of work', 'Though not an easy class, this course was taught very well. I had absolutely no programming experience beforehand, but was able to understand all of the concepts. I encourage you to go to office hours if you are struggling with your code, the staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful when debugging your code. They really want you to understand. Classes were only useful if you needed clarification or help starting the programming assignments. Precept attendance is required, but I found precepts to be where I learned the most. They really do a good job in this course for everyone, even if you have no previous experience programming.', "Don't take this class unless you have to. If you having coding experience you will be fine but if you are a beginner, the course is really not beginner friendly. Although they advertise the class as entry level, it is not. Probably the worst taught class I have taken at this school so far.", "I took it as a distribution requirement, and unless you are interested in learning a computer language or going into computer science, probably don't take it.", "I would recommend this class, even if you don't need to take it and/or you have no experience with COS. I had zero experience at all going into the course, and while it was a steep learning curve, I settled in pretty quickly and ended up enjoying it a lot. If you do decide to take this class, I have one, and only one piece of advice. Do all of your assignments in the Lab TA office hours! ALL OF THEM. Seriously, you will save hours upon hours on these assignments just by picking yourself up and shlepping over to Lewis. The TAs are just so helpful and amazing and there were times that I felt they were able to explain things clearer than some of the instructors. Long story short, unless you think all the programming assignments are super easy, not working on them in the presence of Lab TAs is simply a colossal waste of time.", "don't fall behind", 'This class is a lot of work. Assignments take many hours, but the lab TA resource hours are super helpful and you can rely on that resource. There were some really cool assignments though that made me really appreciate the power of Java.', 'I would not recommend unless they have to take it for a requirement or have an extensive amount of previous java knowledge', 'This was a good course. Might be a bit tougher if you have never done CS before but it prepares you well', 'attendance graded at unhelpful precepts boooo', 'Start the assignments early, and go to office hours of both instructors and LabTas for help.

The "flipped classroom" set up definitely requires more work than if we just learned the content in class, so keep this in mind. If you have the option, definitely get a longer precept because there is a lot of material and I have no idea how it would all be covered in such a short amount of time.', "It's a good class, just stay caught up. I would recommend to anybody, CS or otherwise.", "Before the course: I had never coded. I felt genuine fear every time I saw a black screen with colorful letters on it. When I saw people coding in the library, I would distance myself from them, as it was clear to me that they were the alphas and I did not want to inadvertently challenge their dominance.  After the course: I am a competent coder. I know what computers are and are not capable of. My fear of black screens has dissipated; now I feel like computers are pathetic and weak and I am their master. I now feel very comfortable joining the alpha coders in the library, but I typically don't because they tend to be pretty weird.  But take the course. Stop making excuses. Take it and learn how to do basic coding. Take it and discover your true potential. Stop reading comments, stop being scared, stop weighing other options. Take COS 126, and take control of your destiny.", 'I recommend this class to everyone. Incredibly applicable skillset learned.', "Really great class. If you're at all interested in computer science, take this! It is a bit of work if you haven't done any computer science before, but otherwise it's pretty manageable.  Also, do the readings. The textbook is engaging and reading it will make the entire class infinitely easier.", 'Keep up with the pace of the course and enjoy learning COS.', 'Would take it but take your time.', 'Take it. Will learn a lot.', 'The learning curve is tough but achievable if you have never coded before.', "I recommend taking it if you're interested in coding in Java?the first couple assignments are kinda tedious but they get more interesting.", 'If you have a little bit of coding experience, this course is very manageable. Going to office hours and the lab TAs for the projects makes it a lot easier, and they help guide you through problems (which saves a lot of time). Make sure to keep up with the lectures for the written exams (especially the second one!)', 'COS 126 is a highly organized and very well designed course. I just took it as a second semester senior. It takes a good amount of time, but I am glad I took it and put forth solid effort, as I now consider myself a rather competent programmer (having never coded previously). Doing and understanding the assignments helps the most for programming exams, and watching the lectures and doing the precept exercises and practice exams will help significantly for written exams.', 'This course is challenging if you have no prior coding experience. The most useful resource for the programming assignments are the undergraduate TA office hours and the most useful resource for the exams are the past exams.', "Start as early as  you can on assignments (preferably before the class meeting) and go to office hours, there's so many resources you can seek help and it would be a shame if you fail to take advantage of that. Don't forget to fix stylistic issues on your assignments because they do take that seriously and you will lose points if you don't. I would watch the weekly lecture videos on 2x speed and be prepared to be bored; personally, I didn't find the theory aspect of this course very interesting because I wanted to focus on building programming skills, but I understand why they teach it and this course is an effective introduction into programming anyways. Out of all the exams, the 2nd theory exam is the hardest, so I would study hard and well in advance for that. Recommend PDFing it if it's not a requirement and you're taking it out of pure interest.", 'take during a chill semester if you have no coding experience', 'Great class! The team did a great job of curating an understanding of code structure and strategies while also introducing concepts and fundamental understanding of computers.', 'Take this class if you are at all interested in coding. Pay attention in precept, start the assignments early, and go to Lab TA hours if you need help on the assignments (they are super helpful).', "I highly recommend this course. The assignments are a lot of fun and there is a lot of help available if you get stuck. It's very beginner friendly. To make the most of it make sure to watch the lecture videos, especially once you get to computing theory because it gets very technical and the videos are very helpful.", 'Pay attention second half of the course in precept so prepared for WE2. If took CS AP, projects pretty straightforward.', "If you don't know anything, utilize the resources the classes provide as COS 126 is one of the most organized classes.", 'I loved this course. I thought that this course taught so many cool concepts (machine learning, P vs NP, recursion) in such a fascinating and engaging way. It is very easy to guarantee that you do well in this course since you can always check your code before you turn it in.', 'Go to precept, watch lecture videos .', 'Do your best to keep up especially if you are a first time coder like me. It will seem like a lot at first, but you will later appreciate it at the end of the course.', 'This course was very difficult, but I learned a lot. I had to work harder in this class than any other class so far at Princeton, including chem. I think the majority of students taking it had at least some computer science experience, so I was definitely behind at the beginning. The lack of examples and collaboration was also difficult to deal with. It is very possible to get a good grade, but this class takes a ton of time because I constantly went to office hours and TAs. The lectures are also not helpful at all. Do the longer precepts if you are new to it!!!', 'Very doable, take it. Office hours is very helpful', "Go to all precepts. It is very very easy to fall behind on the video lectures, but if you don't want to have to make a huge effort to re-learn all the material that you skipped at the end of the sem, I'd suggest that you keep up with the material week to week.", "Don't be afraid to ask questions. Enter one of longer precepts if you're not comfortable with COS. It makes the class less intimidating and you'll find others near your level of understanding. Also don't be afraid to go to the Lab TAs for help. If you keep up with the video lectures and make an effort to engage in precept you will do just fine in this class. It's structured incredibly well!", 'Start on assignments early and take advantage of office hours.', "Definitely attend Lab TA hours!!! You can definitely get the assignments done without any concerns if you attend these hours and won't have any major issues.", 'It is a very manageable course, even for someone with very little programming experience. The course site does a great job at guiding you through the exercises, and lecture and precept help reinforce core concepts and techniques for success.', "Important class to take for any major, and it's really not too bad, especially if you go to office hours when you have bugs. Also, I recommend not getting a partner, cause then you're tied to that persons schedule and it can be really annoying. I did every project solo and finished before many of my friends with partners. Also lectures are worthless, the precept exercises are important though", 'Do assignments early', 'Stay on top of precept information', 'Pay attention to non-technical stuff for written exam', 'This course is amazing! Do remember to watch the lecture videos and seek for help whenever you need it!', 'Even if you have to take this course, it will be a positive experience. Highly recommend taking it.Very well-organized; assignments and instruction are clear', 'Make sure you choose a partner who will contribute to group assignments and projects, this really alleviates the burden of the harder assignments around week 7.', "the assignments are interesting and super well-structured, so do not worry even if you don't have prior programming experience. however, a good effort is needed to keep up with the content", 'Great intro computer science course. I took AP CS A in high school and this class was very manageable. If you get stuck on the problem sets, go to office hours, especially the lab TA ones! The queue times are not long and they are very helpful (especially since they can look at your code). Programming assignments are not bad at all especially since they are open notes. First written exam is more nit-picky and code-based, and second is more conceptual/theory-based.']
