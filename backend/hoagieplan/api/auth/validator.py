"""Verifies the Access Token that the backend passes to the resource.

This class validates JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued by an Auth0 domain, 
using the JSON Web Key (JWK) format to handle cryptographic key sets for 
signature verification. 

The validation process follows the JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client 
Authentication and Authorization Grants (RFC 7523), and uses public keys 
fetched from the Auth0 domain's `.well-known` endpoint (RFC 7517).
